he is dreaming of him again walking around,3
well i got an idea but what is your story,3
just give it some more thought,3
what the hell is this,0
you have a business here what the hell is this,0
oh must you be inspired,0
all right but you do not want to think like that because what the hell are we working for chris it is all for you this whole shooting match is for you,0
just do not think like that,0
he saw it,3
he was out here when it broke,3
four o clock this morning i heard a crack and i woke up and looked out he was standing right over there when it cracked,3
i do not know,3
i guess he is,3
you know larry is not coming back and i know it why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him,3
we have got to say it to him,3
sit down mom i want to talk to you,3
you know,3
i am going to ask her to marry me,3
you know it is not just my business,3
so all right then i will just go ahead with it,3
you know sometimes you infuriate me you know that is not it your business if i tell father and he throws a fit about it god you have such a talent for ignoring things,0
i wanted to get this settled first,3
well if she does then that is it that is the end of it from her letters though i think she is pretty much forgotten him,3
and then we will thrash it out with father okay mom do not avoid me,3
i will get out i will get married and i will move somewhere else maybe new york,3
on this i would,3
then help me stay here,3
he is not going to marry her,0
it is got that about it,0
what is going on here joe,0
she is not his girl she knows she is not,0
then why is she still single new york is full of men why is she still single probably a hundred people told her she is foolish but she waited,0
because she knows what i know that is why she is faithful as a rock in my darkest moments i think of her waiting and i know that i am right,0
nobody in this house dares take away her faith joe you know strangers might but not his father not his brother,0
i want you to i want you to act like he is coming back both of you do not think i have not noticed you since chris invited her here,0
i will not stand for any nonsense,0
because if he is not coming back i will kill myself oh laugh laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back she goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces look at it joe look,0
just believe with me joe only last week a man came back in detroit missing longer than larry believe with me you above all have got to believe just believe,0
well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her,3
how do you know he is even thinking about it,3
how do you know why she waited,3
what have i got to hide what the hell is the matter with you kate,0
you are the only one who still loves his parents,3
it is not so bad it is a good thing,3
breathing you know it is lovely here the air is sweet,3
i am not sorry no but i m i cannot stay,3
for one thing your mother much as told me to go,3
and then you you have been kind of,3
sort of embarrassed ever since i got here,3
i knew they would,3
well sure from your mother s point of view why else would i come,3
i umm i guess i guess that is kind of why i came,3
breathing,1
laughter,1
laughter,1
no no,1
chris i have been ready a long long time,3
i almost got married two years ago,3
you started to write me,3
every day since,1
beating around the bush,1
i will never forgive you all i would done was sit around wondering if i was crazy waiting so long wondering if you were thinking about me,1
not like that you are not,1
like larry s brother do it like you chris,3
yeah sure,3
how many,3
aw geez,2
mmhmm,3
what would i do with a fortune,1
i know it kind of went out of style did not it,3
you are not sorry you came,3
well,3
what,3
well i was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so they just take it for granted that we are all set,3
i love you annie i love you,1
i do not really have any imagination that is all i know how to say,1
am i embarrassing you are you see i did not want to do it here with this yard on this porch i wanted it to be somewhere new some place fresh for both of us,1
why did not you let me know,1
give me a,1
give me a kiss,1
oh annie we are going to live now i am going to make you so happy,1
i kissed you,1
hey let us drive some place huh let us get out of here,2
no it is nothing like that it s,2
yeah i suppose i have been but it is going from me,2
i do not even know how to start,2
it is just all mixed up with so many other things you know you know overseas i was in command of a company,2
well i lost them,2
pretty much all,2
you cannot just toss off a thing like that because they were not just men you know,2
like for instance there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks he just put them in my pocket that is a little thing you know but that is what kind of guys i had,2
they did not die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly just a little more selfish and they would all be here today,2
to bring that on to the earth again you know is like some kind of monument and i thought i would just make a difference to them,2
but then i came home and it was incredible you know the whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident you know i went back to the rat race again i went to work,2
and i did not want any of it i guess that included you,2
i just want you to know annie,3
fine,3
that is not your flashlight,3
you keep saying my flashlight like it is just yours,0
how is that supposed to make me feel,0
yeah,3
laughter,1
i am cold,2
not particularly,3
that is the wind,3
about what,3
okay is that is that,1
the flashlight the silver one there is only one is not there,3
whose is it,3
oh well yeah of course,3
no,3
of course our flashlight what is yours is mine me flashlight es su flashlight,3
do they always run during a full moon i do not remember was it full last year,3
huh are you cold do you want my jacket no you know we should have brought the blanket our blanket,3
aw do you know i should have brought a six pack too a six pack that would be just the ticket right about now huh,3
god i am so excited i am like a kid i cannot believe i got out of the house with my fly zipped up,1
right,3
wait that is my point too,3
why not,3
honey this is like a natural phenomenon i mean people in kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this it is just forty minutes away for us it is too good to pass up,3
yeah but this this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do spawning or mating or whatever,3
this is a big night for these little guys it is like life s last orgy,3
there is like mystery here there is magic it is like a little bit of the unexplainable i just cannot see how you are not interested,3
god i do not get it you know the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life,3
and last year i remember distinctly you said you were so excited to get here that you do not remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car,3
ahh we were not in a good spot,3
we just were not in a good spot i am telling you this is a much better spot i have instincts for these things,3
look there see what is that no that is that is just seaweed,1
god this is great think about this i know you are not interested but just think about this,1
just all at once they turned and they formed this line as long as the california coast and some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming,1
it is single mindedness with no mind it is urgency that is just pure urge,1
so what do you think,1
about all of that about all i was talking about,1
that is the wind,3
about what,3
do not ask me that i hate it when you ask me that you always ask me that it is insulting,0
for god grow up augie the fish are not going to arrive,0
because they never do have they have they ever,0
twice is every time we have tried that is ever,0
i feel like i am always just standing here waiting i feel like this night is going to be the night but it never is,2
for god s sake this is not about fish,0
do you remember the first year we came here it was like four years after we got married,3
you whispered the sweetest most intimate things to me right into my ear so i could feel them as much as hear them and i remember thinking this is it you know finally i am as happy as i am supposed to be,1
i would rather not remember some things i would rather not hope for some things,2
no,3
no,3
i know you are augie i know,2
i know you meant this to be special i know that you wanted it to be right but i just cannot help thinking that i cannot help wishing that i was somewhere else,2
i did not say that,2
you are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else somebody who does not take things so seriously who could enjoy herself,2
so maybe we are in the wrong spot but we are with the right person,3
hmm i noticed that it is pretty big old white moon,1
augie you bought refreshments,1
i guess we do not need glasses,1
i am beginning to think this might be the right spot after all,1
augie i am sorry,2
or not,3
look at this all of the hairs are standing up on my arm,1
well so what do you think,1
about what i was saying,3
carla can i ask you something now do not take this the wrong way but are you on your period,3
okay so you were fine during that phone call from marge and then dinner was okay and doing the dishes was fine and then i was going to take a shower and you are watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight do you want to go and i said sure great let us go,3
okay so i am putting out the pets getting the car out of the garage,3
it is when we were driving past that knickerbocker liquor locker you said let us get some champagne i said no time s a wasting or something like that,3
sure all right okay,3
listen do you want to dance,3
do you want me to go get some champagne,3
do you want to take off your shoes,1
do you want to get married again,1
yes it is,3
maybe if you were with someone else too,2
i just i know i do not make you happy,2
you know actually now that you mention it no i don t,3
we have a great view of the moon from here though huh,3
breathing,3
and look what i got here,1
breathing,1
do you want to go home are you cold,3
shh if we are very quiet the fish might come,3
or not,1
laughter that sent shivers up my spine,1
we will behave exquisitely,1
i think i shall do a curtsy,1
yes meaning just that,1
do not laugh at me i am being serious,1
who is they,1
laughter,1
oh elliott worms do not pop,1
aw thank you darling the same applies to you too except that if you so much as look at another woman i will kill you,1
oh charles that was his name he did wiggle so beautifully,1
the manager came in he found us rolling about the floor biting and scratching like panthers laughter how utterly utterly ridiculous,1
laughter and very much sillier,1
i do not care then,1
no wrong number laughter,1
what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us laughter,1
with perfect poise,1
it is strange things that ought to matter dreadfully they just do not matter at all when one s happy do they,1
well what does it all mean that is what i ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth dear god what does it all mean,1
who knows,1
yes yes with all of his might,1
let us be superficial and just pity those poor philosophers huh let us blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can you know like small idiotic school children,1
oh come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets,1
oh see i do not care what you do see you can paint yourself green and run naked through the place vendome and run off with all of the men of the world i shall not say a word just as long as you love me best,1
that was a rouser was not it,1
laughter i will never forget his face laughter,1
laughter we were very much younger then,1
and very much sillier,1
oh you knew there was nothing in that,1
presents it was only a trivial little brooch,1
i did not you worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination,3
well what of it,3
do not be stupid,0
what,0
no i am just making myself fascinating for you,0
oh it is a woman s duty to allure the man,0
no it isn t,0
you shut up,0
they sting i do not care do you understand i do not care if they bark and they roll about like hoops,0
yes i did quite a lot,0
mind your own business,0
you are quite insufferable i expect it is because you are drunk,0
you have always had a weak head,0
on the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy,0
oh shut up,0
shut up,0
not very funny darling why do not you have some more brandy,0
why,3
there are no people upstairs it is a photographer s studio,3
they are away in tunis,3
fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic,0
you are far too temperamental try to control yourself,0
i won t let go let go of me listen listen i am sick and tired of listening to you you sadistic bully,0
oh shut up let go i hate you i hate you do you hear you are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible,0
this is the end do you hear me finally and forever,0
oh yes i am,0
yes i am stop it stop it let go of me oh you are a cruel fiend i loathe and i hate you marry you again never never never i hope you die in torment you brute beast cad,0
however i believe the real cause of that row was peter burden,3
i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him,3
you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden,3
what about me,0
i will have a little i think,3
no particular reason anyhow they are very small ones,3
really amanda,0
you going out somewhere dear,3
well as a matter of fact yes that is perfectly true,3
yes it is,3
oh really it is a pity you did not have any brandy it would have made you a little less disagreeable,0
snap snap snap you know you are like a little adder,0
nonsense they have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap they snap,0
did you see much of peter burden after our divorce,0
and i suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than too yes i suppose you guys had a riotous time huh all out no restraint at all well you never really had much anyhow,0
i think i am not in the least bit drunk,0
i think i mentioned once before that i have had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long a child of two cannot get drunk on that,0
that is very interesting amanda how about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine we can get a good little conversation going on about this you know intemperate tots,0
look you better turn that off i do not want to wake up the people upstairs,0
well then you will wake up the people downstairs,0
this is no time of year for tunis,3
i will do no such thing,0
will you turn that off it is driving me mad,0
turn it off,0
amanda listen listen,0
oh that is very amusing indeed,0
you are a vile ill tempered loose living wicked little beast and i never want to see you again as long as i live,0
you are not going like this,0
you are not,0
shut up shut up god i would not marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee you are a vile ill tempered mean little wench and i never want to see you again as long as i live,0
next,0
my window is open,0
no i need your id to give you a second id,0
it is really simple if you have a problem with it maybe you should,0
what do you expect me to do,0
probably,0
do not raise your voice with me,0
do not talk to me like i am a child,0
do you know how long i have been working here how long have you lived in california,0
maybe you never been to the d m v before maybe you should get back in line you know what sit in line again and if you get my number ask for different one,0
uh huh i did not come here get in yelling match either,3
they do not pay me enough to deal people like you,3
yes jones,3
no i do not have a passport,3
did you even look at the form i filled it out all these questions,0
i am not i m not getting to back that line,0

your housing books everything that is incredible,1
that is incredible do you get like a per diem,1
you should you should look into that,1
that is amazing congratulations good for you,1
oh,3
yeah that you probably you should see one of these victorian houses around by,1
oh venice beach,3
oh you do not like that you are west sider,1
okay that would be way too much of a commute you cannot do that especially i know especially from i do not know what i was going to say i do not know,1

oh that is incredible is it,3
do they have a is it a co ed softball team i mean really you know i did not even know that they have that,1

i mean not to denigrate what you are doing i think that is great,1
no no i love softball i played softball all the time,1
i am not saying you should be i am not no i think it is great i think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you are going to u s c for free for doing it for free,1

for softball they are going to pay me to go to school is not that awesome,1
yeah well i don t well yeah i can pitch i am not like the pitcher though i am like the pinch hitter guy i mostly just hit but i guess i am going to have to yeah and then i play shortstop too but it is so ex the good news is i get to stay here,1

that is a really good idea or i could go to like santa monica go beach venice beach yeah a little dirty though i do not want to go to venice beach but malibu all right,1
professional softball player malibu laughter,1
oh yeah that would be well depends on what type of car you had though too i guess it would be worth it helicopter yeah helicopter there is a helipad there right yeah exactly,1
they do it s believe me it is huge,1
i just got into it i just kind of fell into it literally i was walking around and,1
it is pretty wild,1
yeah well i doubt garbage ping pong garbage,3

he is dreaming about him again walking the streets,0
what do you mean a mistake,0
what can you prove it what proof do you have can you prove it,0
to you it is to me it is but to your father you can talk yourself til you are blue in the face but there is was no grave and there is no body so where are you,0
the trouble is those god damn news papers every month some boy comes back missing longer then larry so,0
why,0
well what do you want me to do you are old enough known your own business,0
i am sorry i ignore what i have got to ignore that girl is larry s girl,0
from father s point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl i am just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but i am saying i do not know where to go see i do not know,0
you are a considerate fellow there is nothing wrong in that,3
did you ask annie yet,3
i do not see why it has to be annie,0
that is a good answer but it does not answer anything you have not seen her since you went away to war it is been five years,0
he thinks he is coming back chris you marry that girl you are pronouncing him dead,2
do you know what that ll do to you to your father do you know i don t,0
are you crazy,0
you have a business here i said what the hell is this,0
oh must you be inspired,0
well you do not want to think like that,0
all right but you do not think like that because what the hell is this all for this is all for you what are we working for chris the whole shooting match is for you,0
well you do not think like that,0
i do not understand you do i,0
well i can see that,0
he saw it,3
i was out here at four this morning i heard a crack and i looked out the window and he was standing right over there,3
i do not know but he went back in the kitchen and he cried,2
no i figured i would just let it wait,2
yeah i could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room,2
i do not know,2
i guess he is,2
i am going to ask her to marry me,3
see then it is not just my business sometimes you infuriate me you know that you know it is just your business too if i tell father and he throws a fit about it huh,0
she is not larry s girl,0
to hell with that,0
no i wanted to get this all sorted out first,2
business the business does not inspire me,0
yes yes i like it for one hour a day i do not care if i have to grub for money all day long when i come home i want it nice i want a family i want to kids and annie is in the center of that,0
yes on this i would,3
then help me stay here mom,2
then help me stay,2
i am thinking like that,0
no you don t i am a pretty tough guy,2
why did he invite her here,0
it is been three and a half years why all of a sudden,0
what is going on here joe,0
the girl is not larry s if the girl is larry s girl she is not his she know she is not,0
i want you to act like he is coming back do not think i have not noticed you both of you since chris invited her here i will not stand for any nonsense,0
oh laugh at me laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back she goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces look at it joe look,0
believe with me joe you got to believe only last week a boy came back missing longer then larry you read it yourself,0
you above all have got to believe just do not stop believing,0
well maybe he wanted see her,3
well uh he grew up next door to the girl why would not he want to see her,3
and how do you know why she is waited,3
what does that mean me above all what does that mean,0
look at you you are shaking,0
what the hell do you want from me kate,0
the only one i know still love his parents,3
oh it is not bad thing it is good thing,3
not sorry no i cannot stay here,2
for one thing your mother as much as told me to go,3
breathing and then you have been kind of,2
you have been kind of embarrassed ever since i got here,2
from her point of view why else would i come,3
i almost got married two years ago,3
everyday since,1
because i was waiting for you chris till then you never wrote me and then when you did well you sure can be ambiguous you know,1
i will never forgive you for waiting so long all i did was sit around and wonder if i was crazy for thinking about you,1
chris what is the matter,2
no what is it is your mother,2
you got to tell me,2
would not work like this,2
yeah sure,2
how many,2
breathing geez,2
do you still feel that way,2
what would i do with a fortune,1
yeah that kind of went out of style did not it,1
you are not sorry you came,1
why not,2
what,3
you did,3
yeah,3
ann i love you i love you,1
why did not you,3
why did not you let me know,1
i kissed you i kissed annie,1
i kissed you,1
do you want to go somewhere let us go,2
no no it is nothing like that,2
i do not know it s it s complicated but it is going from me now,2
i do not know,2
it is kind of all mixed up with all these other things,2
you know over seas i was in command of the company,2
well i lost them,2
pretty much all,2
takes awhile to toss something like that off i mean they were not just men you know,2
for instance there was this one time when this kid it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks,2
he just put it in my pocket that is the kind of guys i had,2
they did not die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly you know a little more selfish and they will all be here today,2
and i had this idea as i was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed you know but i felt like this one new thing was being made you know it is kind of like this this monument,2
you know that they were bringing something on to this earth a kind of sacrifice you know,2
i thought i would change everything you know and i got back here and it was it was like nothing had changed at all,2
you know i went to work with dad and i started that whole rat race again,2
and no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them,2
driving my new car and i felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator,2
because you can take those things out of a war but you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man,2
and if you cannot see that then it is just loot and there is blood all over it,2
i felt ashamed and i did not want any part of it i guess i included you too,2
i want you to know annie,2
i am going to make a fortune for you,1
you keep saying my flashlight like somehow it is just yours how is that supposed to make me feel,0
no,3
i am fine,3
i wonder if they can hear me talk,1
then let us go,0
pass what up these little fish swim out of the ocean they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die,0
yes,0
last year you will also remember we got our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions,0
we did not see them the year before either,0
what time is it god this is great is not it i cannot believe it,1
of course i did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything is it midnight do they always start at midnight is that what it is midnight how you doing huh you okay that is good,1
look there what is that what is that is it,1
oh no i cannot tell though although probably if you cannot tell it probably is not them right yeah probably going to be like unmistakable right,1
gosh this is great is not it this is awesome oh no you know what i forgot,1
flashlight the silver one there is only one is not there,3
oh well yeah of course,3
of course our flashlight what is your is mine mi flashlight es su flashlight,3
gosh i should have brought it i cannot believe i forgot that,3
you know what we should have brought a blanket too man our blanket our blanket wish i had six pack too a six pack would be just the ticket right about now huh six pack,1
oh yeah i am so excited right now i am like a kid,1
i cannot believe i got out of the house without my fly zipped up even,1
right,3
that is my point too,3
people in kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this it is only forty minutes away it is just too good to pass up,0
yeah they do,3
well okay whatever okay but it is a fish who do something that like no other fish do you know it is like those swallows that return to capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs you know,1
it is like a little bit of the unexplainable a little magic a little mystery i just do not see how you can not be interested in this,1
we just were not in a good spot though,3
come on trust me i got instincts for these things okay so just just think about it all right okay i know you are not interested think about it,3
out there there is like this big mass of silver fish they are heading this way,1
they do not know why we do not know why no one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction,1
they just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the california coast and they just started swimming,1
like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies and they all turned as one,1
and form the line and started swimming swimming that would bring them to this point here,1
it is like urgency that is pure urge you know it is single mindedness with no mind,1
it is crazy look at this i am giving myself goose bumps the hairs are standing up on my arm,1
that is the wind,3
why do you ask me that god damn it i told you not to ask me that i hate it when you ask me that it is insulting,0
i just we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like,0
because they never do do they have they ever,0
twice is every year we have tried that is ever,0
no we won t it is pointless it is like a waiting up to see santa claus,0
i feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show,0
do you remember the first year we came here it is about four years ago right after we got married,3
and i remember thinking this is it finally finally i am as happy as i am supposed to be,2
i would rather not remember some things i would rather not hope for some things,2
no,2
no,2
i want something to turn out the way that it is supposed to,0
this what what is this this is not even anything,0
oh sure this is standing on the beach this is waiting fighting,0
this is not anything like i thought anything would be,2
this is just this i mean it includes a lot and everything but it s do you understand what i am saying,2
i know that augie i really do,2
i just cannot help wishing that i was somebody somewhere else,2
i did not say that,2
you are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else someone who did not take everything so seriously someone who would enjoy yourself,2
i guess we do not need glasses,1
i am beginning to think you might be right i think this might be the spot after all,1
augie i am sorry,2
or not,3
to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death,1
look at this my hairs are standing up my arm i am giving myself goose bumps,1
well so what do you think,1
can i ask you a question are you on your period,3
we missed them twice,3
you were fine during the phone call from marge dinner was okay doing the dishes was fine,3
let us see uh i took a shower and um you were watching the news and you said the the grunions are running tonight and i said okay great let us go,3
so i am putting the animals out we are getting the car to the garage and,3
wait a minute i have got it,3
it was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said no you said let s get some champagne and i said no time to wasting or something like that that is what it is right,3
oh right sure of course,3
you want me to go get some champagne,3
do you want to take off our shoes,3
what huh,3
you want to get married again,3
a new carpet a poodle a suicide pact ice cream a back rub what what what the hell do you want,0
you think nothing turns out how it is supposed to you think i had some grand idea going that four years down the line we would come to this beach and argue over fish no,0
no no i am just like you i thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and,2
no you know what you get you know what you get you get this,2
yeah it is,3
right,3
i know me neither,2
i am doing the best i can,2
maybe if you were with somebody else too,2
no i know but i know i do not make you happy,2
yeah,2
look what we got here,1
it is not champagne,3
are you cold huh do you want to go home,3
shh,1
if we are really quiet the fish might come,1
or not,3
now and always sweet,1
it had to happen sooner or later,1
breathing,1
oh behave exquisitely,1
laughter i think i shall do a court curtsey,1
laughter,1
mmm,1
oh yes meaning just that,1
laughter do not laugh at me i am being serious,1
mmhmm if i must laugh at everything i must laugh at us too,1
how long will it last this ludicrous overbearing love of ours,1
shall we always want to bicker and fight,1
if one of us dies,1
i think you are talking nonsense,1
which particular one,1
oh charles that was his name charles he did wriggle so beautifully,1
cannes mmhmm,1
the manager came in he found us rolling about the floor laughter,1
scratching and biting like panthers laughter oh,1
utterly utterly ridiculous,1
oh laughter,1
very much sillier,1
oh you knew there was nothing in that,1
i do not care then,1
with perfect poise,1
ah,1
ah strange,1
things that just ought to matter dreadfully you know they just do not matter at all when one is happy do they,1
darling do not say that,2
oh dear god what is that all mean dear god,1
you must not be so serious darling it just what they want,1
flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light,1
we are figures of fun all right,1
ahh who knows,1
let us pity the poor philosophers huh let us enjoy the party for as long as we can okay let us blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children laughter,1
come here darling kiss me,1
before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets,1
see you know i do not care what you do you could paint yourself green and run naked to the place vendome,1
do you remember that row we did have in venice,1
but you know it was not as bad as the one we had in cannes mmhmm where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown,1
i will never forget the look on his face,1
oh,1
we were very much younger then,1
well what of it,3
no thank you,3
i do not see why you want any you already had two glasses,0

they sting,0
i do not care i do not care do you understand i do not mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops,0
yes i did quite a lot,0
oh mind you own business,0
you are quite insufferable i expect it is because you are drunk,0
you always had a weak head,0
on the contrary a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy,0
shut up,0
not very funny darling why do not you have some more brandy,0
why,0
they are away in tunis,0
turn it on again please,0
very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic,0

no you cannot think that way i mean it is good it s good that you re that you are calling you know you cannot,3
no come on do not garbage,3
i know i know it is hard but you just you gotta keep going i mean you have been going at it for so long you know something is definitely going to come up i i know it will because you are a good worker,3
no it s i mean it is competitive you know that s that s what it is that is what you gotta be is competitive,3
there there are plenty of people out there with with like good jobs you know that are a lot,3
dumber than you i mean they are a lot worse off than you you are much better off than like a lot of those people in there i know,3
i know it makes it harder i mean it is definitely who you know in a lot of cases but,3
but you gotta otherwise what is what s your other option,3
it is not worthless because it is definitely gonna it s definitely gonna pay off i know it i mean i can i ve just i ve seen your work etiquette you know you are a good worker and,3
and there is no reason that that something will not come up like really soon all right so you just gotta,3
because i know you you know and maybe once you get to know some more people like talking to them and everything they will get to know you too and they will realize they should have hired you three years ago you know but and and they will finally come around and believe me it ll you gotta,3
well maybe yeah but maybe you get to that point where it is like you bug em and then they just do not wanna hear from you anymore but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it is gonna annoy them so much that they are gonna be like all right fine you know,3
that obviously that is not true though i mean you have done this before you have done all the work like this before you know and and you have gotten people saying oh you are so good and like you know,3
right,3
well you have gotta live,3
i mean it is just it is really i do not know yeah it is about their opinions and it is about i do not know just getting yourself out there and,3
well come on come on thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though,3
hi um excuse me i believe that the airline lost my baggage,3
no it didn t um it did not come out and i do not see it anywhere around here so what can you do about that,3
how much,3
that is all that is all that is all you are going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff,0
because you do not seem to care very much you know,0
it sounds like it is such a little like oh well no big deal whatever it is a big deal to me,0
um okay it didn t didn t come out on the carrousel,3
okay um well unfortunately yeah there was a some some problems with the,3
uh well some some of the bags were were lost on the way over here uh,3
you know i mean there is a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes you know that kind of things happen,3
uh but we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents,3
um we would be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for,3
right uh we realize you know that that it is a bad situation but i am sorry there is nothing that we can really do,3
i think um maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office,3
right no i mean they they might they might if you if you are argue the case more maybe they will reimburse you more but right now,3
yes i know i know it is it is frustrating unfortunately though um,3
by checking your bags you you you know admit to the liability that s that is at risk,3
right well by checking in your bags you agreed to you know at the will of the,3
you paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at it s a service that the airline provides for us so so really it is really the risk was taken and i am sorry but there is really nothing else we can do so do you want do you want the reimbursement,3
well there are there are some shops here in in the airport,3
no um like i said you can file a claim and uh maybe get reimbursed for more you,3
probably even talk to,3
right that that gets taken care of that gets taken care of we get we do you know we investigate those and just make sure that um they are not doing their own thing with them so uh,3
but unfortunately sometimes is,3
well that s that s what i am saying,3
okay well that that could be something that you put on on the claim on on the complaint form if you want and provide us with your information while you are here and then maybe if it turns up then we will send it right over,3
all right miss i i know i realize this but like i said there are several people that are in your same situation so um it is not it s not totally uncommon and i am actually gonna have to ask you to move so i can help the next person,3
yes all right there you go now you can file a claim over to the left and they will help you out,3
um johnny died yesterday,2
we knew that it was coming but,2
it seemed like he had a little bit longer like just last week he was doing was so well,2
yeah,2
i just do not want him to be gone,2
and his whole family was there,2
i mean he was like really conscious right up until the end you know,2
he was so young you know and all the stories he used to tell me about,2
the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to africa and he was gonna,2
nobody s ever gonna forget him,2
he did a lot but,2
i am gonna forget him,2
i will not be able to hear his voice or his,2
you start to lose like that image after a while,2
thanks,2
hey a what is up,3
wow that is horrible,3
i am sorry to hear about that,3
yeah,3
i mean you know at least he is not in anymore pain now right,3
it is good you know you know it hurts i know i know what it is like to lose someone like that,3
it is okay,3
cause you know you have got all the times that you guys did spend together you know and that is something good that you can look back on,3
i mean i do not know,3
well that is that is good you know at least i do not know i mean it s it is better to go to goout that way than,3
than you know in pain and like this gradual this horrible process i mean,3
but look at the he look at the life he did get to lead i mean for his age he would done so much and,3
yeah exactly he is made a big impact on a lot of people and,3
and you will always have that and you should feel you know happy for him that he got to do so much before i mean and even after he found out last year i mean,3
i know it does not bring him back but,3
but it is okay because now you know you will just go on with your life and,3
no you will never forget him,3
i know but you are not i mean you are not going to forget him the pain will go away eventually and or it will subside,3
that will be it will be it ll be better that way i mean time will tell time heals you know and it is good it is okay i mean it was not anybody s fault or anything like that so,3
it is hard to lose someone that way but he is he is better he s better off now,3

oh yeah absolutely you know and especially because you have been waiting so long and i know that um you have been having a difficult time,3
i want to definitely give you our special package today which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,3
um lots of purchases but we are gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway uh just to make sure that you are happy with your service here,3

absolutely we we,3
yes i completely understand actually our our airline only uses five star hotel and above except we charge at a three star hotel rate because as a corporation we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves,3
so you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it is in a area of town that you like as well,3
yeah,3
okay,3

okay great what time of the day would you like,3
all right great well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a m and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that,3
so it is a five hour flight but you will arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning so that day you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in maui,3
absolutely that actually goes in on the same package with our hotel you just give me your address we will come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare,3
and a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel,3
yeah i completely understand it is a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible,3
absolutely thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again,3
thank you,3
okay,3
you you can do that you can do that now i do not have to get like transferred through or anything like that,3
breathing that is good,3

all right so we are confirmed then or do you all right,3
okay,3
did you talk to him,2
he cried hard,2
what was he doing out here at that hour,2
i have got an idea but what is the story,2
well that is only your business chris,3
what do you want me to do you are old enough to know your own mind,0
i am just saying that,3
you are a considerate fellow there is nothing wrong with that,3
breathing have you asked annie yet,3
well how do you know she will marry you maybe she feels the same way your father does,3
trouble is you do not see enough women,2
are you crazy,0
what about the business what the hell is this,0
must you be inspired,0
well you do not want to think like that,0
i can see that,2
why should not he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him do we contradict him do we say straight out that we do not have any hope anymore that we have not had hope for years now,0
for god sakes it is been three years nobody comes back after three years it is insane,0
i am gonna ask her to marry me,3
well then it is not just my business,0
she is not larry s girl,0
to hell with that,0
well if she does then that is the end of it but from her letters i think she is forgotten him i will find out and then we will thrash it out with dad right mom do not avoid me,2
because it is,3
i have been a good son too long a good sucker i am through with it,0
the business the business does not inspire me,0
yes i like it an hour a day if i am gonna grub for my money all day long at least in the evening i want it beautiful,0
yes on this i would,3
i am thinkin that way,3
no you don t i am a pretty tough guy,3
it is got that all about it,0
because if he is not coming back i will kill myself i mean laugh laugh at me but,0
but why did that happen the very night she came here she sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces just look look at it,0
well maybe he just wanted to see her again,3
what do you mean he lived next door to the girl all his life why would not he want to see her again,3
how do you know he is even thinking of it,3
well so what,3
now listen kate,3
you cannot read her mind,3
how do you know why she is waited,3
what does that mean me above all,0
look at you look at you shaking,0
what have i got to hide what the hell is the matter with you kate,0
from her point of view why else would i come,2
i almost got married two years ago,1
you started to write me and,1
every day since,1
i will never forgive you why did you wait all these years all i did was sit and wonder if i was crazy for thinking of you,1
then what is wrong i mean even in your letters there was some something ashamed,2
you have gotta tell me,2
it would not work this way,2
yeah sure,2
how many,2
oh gee,2
you still feel that way,2
what will i do with a fortune,1
you are not sorry you came,3
you feel it is wrong here do not you this yard this chair i want you to be ready for me i do not want to have to win you away from anything,1
no nothing like that,2
yeah i suppose i have been but it is going from me,2
i do not know how to start,2
it is all mixed up with so many other things you remember overseas i was in command of a company,2
well i lost them,2
just about all,2
it takes some time for a guy to toss that off because they were not just men,2
for instance one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks i put them in pocket it is only a little thing but that is the kind of guys i had,2
they did not die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly a little more selfish and they would have been here today,2
i got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that there was one new thing being made a sort of responsibility man for man,2
you know what i mean to show that to bring that onto the earth again like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him,2
then i came back and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident i went to work with dad and that rat race again,2
and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book drive the new car see the new refrigerator,2
i mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car you have gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man you have gotta be a little better because of it,2
because otherwise all you have is really loot and there is blood on it and i did not want to take any of it and i guess that included you,2
what flashlight,3
yeah,3
we did not see them the first time either,3
about what,3
what time is it they are supposed to run around midnight,1
this is great is not it look at the night we have got here could not be better,1
i would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid we would miss it,1
how you doing,1
is that no is that just foam i cannot even tell,1
well i guess we can tell it probably is not right probably be unmistakable do not you think,1
how you doing aw you know what i forgot i forgot to bring my flashlight oh how could i be so stupid i should have brought my flashlight,1
oh well sure,3
right of course our flashlight mine and yours i mean me flashlight is su flashlight naturally,3
i wonder do they always run during a full moon i cannot remember if it was full last year do you remember,3
you cold do you want my jacket oh we should have brought the blanket our blanket,3
this is great is not it a six pack would be just the ticket right now,1
i cannot believe i forgot i am like a kid it is amazing i got out of the house with my fly zipped,1
you think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around,1
do you want my jacket,3
right,3
that is my point too,3
no no that is not my point the point is there is no point in coming down if we just leave do not you want to see it,3
think about the people in kansas they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this we live forty minutes away it is too good to pass up,1
yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating i mean,1
this is a big night for these guys life s last orgy,1
alright but it is fish that do something that none of the other fish do like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs,1
i do not get it the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life,3
we were not in a good spot,3
there is that no that is just seaweed is not it,1
oh man this is great is not it i would not miss this for anything here think about this all right i know you are not interested but think about this,1
all as one this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming and they are swimming right now as if that is all that matters,1
it is like single mindedness with no mind it is urgency that is pure urge they do not know what drives them they do not ask it a question or give it a name,1
they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death,1
ah god i am giving myself goose bumps look all my hairs are popped up,1
well so what do you think,3
what i was saying,3
about what,3
god damn it augie do not ask me that i hate it when you ask me that you always ask me that it is insulting,0
we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like,0
i mean i feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up,0
do you remember the first time we came to see it it was about four years ago right after we got married,2
i thought i was pregnant you had a bottle of champagne but no glasses you asked me to dance so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork,2
and while we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ear so that i could feel them as much as hear them,2
and i remember thinking this is it you know at last at last i am as happy as i am supposed to be,2
just dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle,2
i would rather not remember some things i would rather not hope for some things,2
no,2
no,2
no,2
well this is not anything like i thought anything would be like,2
i know that augie really i do,2
i know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all but i just could not help thinking about being somewhere else,2
i did not say that,2
you are the one who probably wishes you were with someone else someone who you d rather enjoy yourself and did not take everything so hard,2
augie you brought refreshments,1
well then we do not need glasses,1
no i think you might be right maybe this is the spot after all,1
augie i am sorry,2
or not,1
well so what do you think,1
what i was saying,3
it certainly is not it is slightly exaggerated scientific fact,3
well i am not the only one look at all these people,3
carla can i ask you something do not take this wrong but are you having your period,3
there is nothing to it we come here the grunion arrive they do their little fish business we go ooh ah look at the fish they go home we go home,3
we have missed them twice that is not ever,3
well we will see them this year,3
it is just fish nothing to get traumatized about,3
you said hey the grunion are running tonight i said great let us go i feel lucky,3
okay so i am putting on my jacket putting out the animals getting the car out of the garage,3
wait a minute i have got it,3
it was in the car right driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker you said let s get some champagne and i said time s a wasting or something like that right,3
yeah of course i see it now you want this to be like that other time right that is it right,3
okay yeah sure i see it now listen you wanna dance,3
you want me to go get some champagne,3
take off our shoes,3
well welcome to the human race do you think this is what i had in mind when i proposed that four years down the road we would be at the beach yelling at each other over fish,0
no carla i am just like you i thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and ha ha baby the joke s on us,2
yes it is,3
right,3
i know me neither,2
i am doing the best i can,2
maybe if you were with somebody else too,2
no i know but still i know i do not make you happy,2
i do not know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me i mean look at the view you have of the moon from here,1
well look what we have here,1
it is not champagne,1
shh if we are very quiet the fish might come,1
or not,1
ah it send shivers up my spine,1
behave exquisitely,1
oh of course i shall probably do a court curtsy,1
what is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy,1
it is true the whole business is a very poor joke,1
yes meaning just that,1
who is they,3
if i laugh at everything then i must laugh at us too,3
well how long will it last us this ludicrous overbearing love of ours,3
well shall we always want to bicker and fight,3
oh dear shall we like that,3
well what happens if one of us dies i mean does the one that is left still laugh,3
darling i believe you are talking nonsense,1
elliott worms do not pop,1
oh thank you dear the same applies to you except that if i catch so much as looking at another woman i will kill you,1
which particular one,1
charles that was his name charles he did wriggle so beautifully,1
yes i know you did you threw it out of the window into the grand canal i do not think i will ever forgive you for that,1
it went in intermittently for days,1
it burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom,1
that was the first time you ever hit me,3
the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers,1
it was ridiculous completely ridiculous,1
i wonder,3
i do not care then,3
hello hello what wrong number,3
with the most perfect poise,3
things that ought to matter dreadfully do not matter at all when one s happy do they,3
oh darling do not say that,3
meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love,3
you must not be serious my dear one that is just what they want,3
all those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable laugh at them be flippant laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths,3
flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light,3
certainly you must we are figures of fun alright,3
who knows,3
no that desire will fade along with our passion,3
depends on how well we have played,3
yes yes with all his might,1
no no it isn t death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors,1
so is everyone else in the long run,3
let us be superficial and pity the poor philosophers let us blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like quite idiotic very small school children let us savor the delight of the moment,1
come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets,1
i do not care what you do see you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the place vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and i shall not say a word as long as you love me best,3
you remember that awful scene we had in venice,3
the one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the piazza and put it on my bed,3
how long did that row last,3
the worst one was in cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown,3
i did not hit you very hard,3
oh i will never forget his face,1
we were very much younger then,3
as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden,3
well if you had not been so suspicious and nosey you never would have known a thing about it,3
just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing,3
well it is become a habit with you,3

oh you did not,1
oh my gosh that is so cute,1
that is so romantic oh my gosh she must have died that is like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this oh my god,1

oh you are never going to believe it,1
well i finally did it,1
yes she said yes laughter i know,1
yes yes you know she she was like i mean she was happy you know,1
i i think it was about time i do not know maybe you know what it is been it is been long enough now,1
oh well it was you know we were at this at this concert and yeah,1
so i i talked to some of the crew before hand and,1
i i did,1
i know so,1
i got to freak her out,1
no yes so,1
yea that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no,1
no but it was good,1
yes yes laughter,1
i know it was i do not know i was really nervous but i am really i am really glad,1
oh yes they they you know they love her and so i mean,1
yea yea i am not too sure where yet i guess you know i kind of got to figure some stuff out here first,1
i know,1
oh it will obviously you know but i know it is something i do not know you never really think about it happening like before hand,1
sure oh yes,1
yes well thanks thanks thank you yeah,1
hah,1
so how you feeling,3
you have been doing a lot of work for it right,3
right so the fact you doing the best that you can is,3
you know you should not give yourself a hard time for that it is the best you can,3
well but you care about what you do right,3
i understand that it is so frustrating but i know that you are here because you really want it you know and and uh,3
well i mean you are still here you have tried for this long so i think that says something all in itself,3
you are persistence i mean that is important that is,3
well you are talented so keep that in mind you know you should not give yourself too hard of a time,3
i am sorry,2
that s i mean there are more factors then just whether you are good or not you know what i mean like,3
and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it is male or female or you know what i mean like things are out of your control,3
so you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time,3
you know and the fact you still here and still cooking like it is good that you are thinking about it that you are reconsidering,3
but like just because you are considering why it is been so difficult does not mean you should just stop,3
maybe you should take a little break from it but i do not think you should stop,3
i do not know it is just not i do not know i do not know what to do really you know i am just thinking,2
this does not happen to a normal person,0
right thanks for talking to me,2
hi can i help you,3
oh did you check did you make sure as it went around the second time that it,3
okay well um the f,3
actually i am looking here at the information the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage it looks like a few peoples bags did not make it through um so,3
well you can fill out this paperwork um and if for some reason it shows up we can bring it to you but,3
well sometimes it is just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just i am reading off of this that,3
uh it did not make it into the second plane so it looks like there they do not actually know what happened to it,3
um well sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane uh there can be a theft or uh some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something,3
i i i understand but um,3
okay,3
right,3
i understand that um so i am going to put down here that you looking for your baggage but we actually can t uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we are going to do,3
sometimes it gets stolen sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and,3
they they it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it is stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that,3
so we ll what we will do,3
right like i said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim reimburse you,3
um so,3
we have very tight security but we uh there are times when we just cannot uh make sure there are not absolutely no human error you know,3
i am sorry there is no guarantee on baggage,3
i understand so,3
all right we have already checked back here for your baggage,3
and we will continue to look for it and because your paper,3
well it s it is just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than,3
the airline cannot afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase and so,3
well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we do not want to have false claims or anything like that so we have,3
we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it to compensate and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely more than likely,3
hi um,3
it seems that uh my my bag did not make it out on the carousel,3
yes yes it is gone around like you know twenty times it is been about a half hour,3
okay so what what do i have to get you know,3
but we have the tags on i mean like it would not you know if it got stuck somewhere it is like well this is nobodies bag i mean maybe you know look on the tag and,0
theft do not you know like all these people that are work you keep like an eye on them how can they get away with,0
you do not realize the stuff that i have got in that i really need to get the suitcase okay,0
the a what talking about a core they cannot afford it i mean,0
i mean you are not helping me here what do i have to do here do i need to sue the airline company is that what i should do,0
it does not make any easier yes,2
oh man i am so sorry,2
it is going to be so rough i am sorry,2
yeah,2
totally,2
yeah,2
yes well at least you have a lot of good memories,2
she really cared about you you know,2
and she was,2
yeah,2
even if you still do she ll she will be there,2
are you going to be okay,2
it is going to be okay i promise,2
sure,2
you should not be alone,2
yes,2
yes,2
kathy died last night,2
yeah i mean you know it was a,2
i guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot a lot longer than uh they expected but you know i mean when it actually happens it is just a lot harder,2
i mean at least she was home she was not in the hospital anymore,2
she was with yeah she was with gary and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep closed her eyes and that was it,2
yes i mean it is not as rough on me as it is on him but,2
god it is you know we have spent so much time with them it is just really surreal really weird that we are not going to be able to see her anymore and go,2
out to out to dinner you know and do the troops to california i mean,2
it is just that i do not know it is sort it is sort of a weird thing you know,2
not being able to see anyone again who knows where they really went you know i mean i guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it is anywhere that it is better i mean,2
she was garbage,2
yes i mean she cared about all of us she was great,2
so loving everybody you know,2
gosh i just hate i just hate to see her go,2
we were all going take a trip to europe you know,2
yes breathing god,2
i just i just do not get it like there is just nothing you can do about it you know it is like just out of your control and it,2
just makes it that much harder to deal because as much as you want to you know make her better see her not in any pain it is like just i do not know just has a mind of its own,2
then she is gone,2
well you know i appreciate you coming over and talking to me i mean it definitely helps,2

pretend like your on a rotary phone goes straight through to a person,3

okay,3
uh i mean have you been shopping around on the internet and stuff i mean that you gave,3

and never you know give it to anyone out never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you have not heard of or anything like that all right because um we want to we definitely want to help you out but,3
you know it gets it gets difficult you know so alright,3
alright yes i am sorry for all the inconvenience but we will get it taken care of,3
i got an idea but what is the story,3
well you want to make sure that your father isn t,3
from father s point of you he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl,3
you are a considerate fellow there is nothing wrong with that,3
how do you know she will marry you maybe she feels the same way your father does,3
trouble is you do not see enough women you never did,0
i just do not see why it has to be annie,0
what the hell is this,0
what the hell is this are you crazy,0
what about the business what is this,0
must you be inspired,0
tell me you would leave the business,0
well you do not want to think like that,0
yea i can see that,2
i do not know when it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen,2
no i figured it was best to leave him alone,2
i could hear him right through the floor in my room,2
we have got to say it to him,0
for god sakes it is been three years nobody comes back after three years that is insane,0
you know why i brought annie here do not you,3
you know,3
i am going to ask her to marry me,3
see it is not just my business,0
i do not know why but every time i reach out for something that i really want i have to pull back because someone else will suffer my whole bloody life time after time after time,0
to hell with that,0
i wanted to get this settled first,3
well if she does then that is the end of it from her letters i think she is forgotten him,3
i do not know i will find out then we will trash it out with dad right mom do not avoid me,2
if i cannot do that here well then i will have to get out,2
i will get out i will get married and go live some place else maybe new york,2
i have been a good son too long a good sucker i am through with it,0
the business the business does not inspire me,0
yes i like it and hour a day if i am going to grub for money all day long at least in the evening i want it beautiful,0
yes on this i would,2
why did he invite her here,0
she is been in new york three and half years why all of a sudden,0
nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see,0
he is not going to marry her,0
what is going on here joe,0
she s not his girl joe she knows she is not,0
i want you to act like he is coming back both of you do not you think i have not noticed since he invited her i will not stand for any nonsense,0
i need you to believe with me i cannot stand all alone,2
well maybe he just wanted to see her again,3
how do you know he is even thinking of it,3
well so what,3
you cannot read her mind,3
what does that mean me above all,0
look at you look at you shaking,0
it is all right it is a good thing,1
you know it is lovely here the air is sweet,1
no not sorry but um but i am not gonna stay,1
i knew they would your mother anyway,1
well from her point of view why else would i come,3
i guess this is why i came,1
well you started to write me,1
every day since,1
well what is wrong i mean even in your letters there was some something ashamed,2
it would not work this way,2
do you still feel that way,2
because you must not feel that way because you have a right to everything you have chris everything you understand that me too,2
i mean and your money there s there is nothing wrong with your money i mean your father put hundreds of planes in the air a man should be paid for that,2
what will i do with a fortune,1
i know it went out of style did not it,1
i am embarrassing you and i did not want to tell it to you here i wanted some place we would never been before a place where we would be brand new to each other,1
you felt something that far back,1
ann why did not you let me know,1
let us drive someplace i want to be alone with you,2
no nothing like that,2
yeah i suppose i have been but it is going from me,2
well i lost them,2
just about all,2
it takes some time for a guy to toss that off because they were not just men,2
for instance this one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks i put them in pocket it is only a little thing but those are the kind of guys i had,2
they did not die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly i mean a little more selfish and they would have been here today,2
i got this idea watching em go down everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that one new thing was made a sort of responsibility man for man you know what i mean,2
to show that to bring that onto the earth again like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him,2
then i came back and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here i mean the whole thing to them seemed like it is sort of a bus accident i went to work with dad and that rat race again,2
and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book drive the new car see the new refrigerator,2
i mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car you have gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man you have gotta be a little better because of it,2
otherwise all you have is really loot and there is blood on it and i did not want to take any of that and i guess that included you,2
i want you now annie,3
fine,3
what flashlight,3
yea,3
i am cold,3
not particularly,3
i am just not,2
yes,3
last year you will also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got into a big fight over nothing and we did not see the grunions,0
that is the wind,3
about what,3
what time is it they are supposed to run around midnight,1
god this great is not it like look at the night we go here it could not be better,1
how you doing,1
is that is that no was that just foam i cannot even tell,1
although i guess you cannot tell it probably is not them probably be unmistakable do not you think,1
how you doing you know what i forgot i forgot to bring my flashlight how how could i forget to bring my flashlight how could i be so stupid,1
you cold you want my jacket we should have we should have brought our blanket our blanket how could we forget to bring the blanket,1
oh a six pack that s should have brought a a six pack be just the ticket right now how could i forget,1
oh man like a kid it is amazing i got out of the house with my fly zipped,1
you think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around,1
honey this is a natural phenomenon i mean it only happens once a year,1
think about the people in kansas they they would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this we live forty minutes away it is too good to pass up,1
yea but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives i mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you mating or spotting or something like that,1
this is a big night for these guys life s last orgy,1
okay but it is fish that do something none of the other fish do like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs,1
you know there is like there is a certain mystery here a magic a bit of the unexplainable i do not see how you cannot be interested,1
there is that oh no that is just seaweed is not it,1
this is this is great is not it i would not miss this for anything now listen to this i know you are not interested but just listen,1
out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,1
they do not why we do not know why they did not take a vote or anything they did not get a map or an invitation,1
just all as one this little time sensitive firecracker instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the california coast and started swimming they are swimming right now as if that is the only thing that matters,1
it is single mindedness with no mind it is urgency that is pure urge they do not know what drives them they do not ask it a name or ask it a question,1
they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death,1
look at me i am giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up,1
goddamn it augie do not ask me that i hate it when you ask me that you always ask me that it is insulting,0
we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like,0
i mean i feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish will not show up,0
i did want to see them i always do i mean i keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is,0
do you remember the first time we came to see it it was about four years ago right after we got married,2
we thought i was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses you asked me to dance we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork,2
and when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so i could feel them as much as hear them,2
and i remember thinking that this is it you know at last at last i am as happy as i am supposed to be,2
just dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle,2
i would rather not remember some things i would rather not hope for some things,2
no,2
no,2
well but this is not anything like i thought anything would be like,2
i know that you meant this to be special and nice and there is the sand and the moon and everything but i just could not help thinking about being somewhere else,2
do not be ridiculous i mean do not you know that,1
you are the one who probably wishes he was with someone else someone who knew how to enjoy herself and did not take everything so hard,2
well i guess we do not need glasses,1
augie i am sorry,2
or not,1
hmm,3
so what do you think,3
what i was saying,3
certainly it is not slightly exaggerated scientific fact,3
well we will see them this year,3
you were fine during the phone call from marge dinner was okay doing the dishes was no problem let us see i took a shower you watched the news you said,3
the grunion are running tonight i said great let us go i feel lucky,3
okay so i am getting on my jacket and putting out the animals getting the car out of the garage,3
it was in the car right driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker you said let us get some champagne and i said times are wasting or something like that right,1
of course i see it now you want this to be like that other time right that is it right,1
yea okay sure no i see listen you want to dance,3
you want to go get some champagne,3
take off our shoes,3
get married again,3
well welcome to the human race all right do you think this is what i had in mind when i proposed you think i had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would come to the beach and yell at each other over fish,0
no i know me neither,2
maybe if you were with somebody else too,2
no i know but still i know i do not make you happy,2
now that you mention it no i don t,1
i do not know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me look at the moon view the moon view i got from here,1
what have we got here,1
shh if we are very quiet the fish might come,1
or not,1
what are we going to do,1
now and always sweet,1
oh it sends shivers down my spine,1
behave exquisitely,1
yes i should probably to a court curtsey,1
who is they,1
oh dear should we like that,2
which particular one,1
oh charles that was his name charles it did wiggle so beautifully,1
i know you did you threw it out of the window into the grand canal i do not think i will ever forgive you for that,1
it went on intermittently for days,1
it burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom,1
the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers,1
oh it was ridiculous completely ridiculous,1
and very much sillier,1
hello hello what wrong number,1
with the most perfect poise,1
things that ought to matter dreadfully do not matter at all when one s is happy do they,1
oh darling do not say that,2
meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love,1
what does it all mean that is what i ask that is what i ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth good god what does it all mean,1
you must not be serious my dear one that is just what they want,1
flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light,1
certainly you must we figures of fun all right,1
no that desire will fade along with our passion,2
yes yes with all his might,1
no no it isn t death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors,1
so is everyone else in the long run,1
let us be superficial and pity the poor philosophers let us blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like quite idiotic very small school children let us savor the delight of the moment,1
come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets,1
you remember that awful scene we had in venice,1
that was a rouser was not it,1
i will never forget his face,1
you knew there was nothing in that,1
presents just a trivial little broach,1
no it wasn t it was very pretty i still have it and i wear it often,3
no i didn t you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination,3
what of it,3
it gave him a lot of pleasure it did not hurt me any,3
well if you had not been so nosey and suspicious you never would not have known anything about it,3
no thanks,3
it just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing,3
well it is become a habit with you,3
what,0
no i am just making myself fascinating for you,3
be quiet,0
i do not care do you understand i do not care i do not care if they bark or roll about like hoops,0
yes i did quite a lot,3
oh be quiet,0
you are far too temperamental try to control yourself,0
stop it stop it i hate you,0
listen indeed i am sick and tired of listening to you damn sadistic bully,0
stop it stop it i hate you do you hear you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible,0
this is the end do you hear the end finally and forever,0
oh yes i am,0
yes i am let go of me you are cruel fiend and i hate and loathe you thank god i realized who you really are before i would ever ever marry you again i would never marry you again i would rather die in torment,0
you are a beast i hate you stop it stop it,0
as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden,3
i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him,0
you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden,0
you let him kiss you you said you did,0
what about me,0
i have a little i think,3
no particular reason anyhow they are very small ones,3
you can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on,3
going out somewhere dear,3
as a matter of fact that is perfectly true,3
tell me did you see much of peter burden after our divorce,3
what riotous time you must have had,0
no restraint at all very enjoyable never had much anyhow,0
we can get a good little debate going about that do not you think intemperate tots,0
all right i will,3
better turn that off i think,3
turn it off,0
amanda listen listen,0
very amusing indeed,0
you are a vile tempered loose living wicked little beast and i hope i never see you again as long as i live,0
you are not going like this,0
you are not,0
shut up,0
shut up,0
i would not marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees you are a evil minded little vampire i hope to god i never see you again as long as i live,0
what is wrong,3

what do you mean dishonest,3
they do come back,3
it is those goddamn newspapers you know i mean it is like every day they come out with this new person that comes along and the next one s going to be larry,0
why,3
well that is only your business chris,3
you are a considerate fella and there is nothing wrong in that,3
there is nothing wrong with it,3
tell me something,3
you would leave that business,3
i am going to,3
i do not know you do i,3
yeah i can see that,3
he saw it,3
he was out there when it happened,3
um about four this morning uh i heard a crack and i looked out and i saw him standing there,3
i do not know but after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen,3
no i uh i figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone,3
i could hear it right through the floor,3
i guess he is,3
i do not know,3
but i know one thing mom we have made a terrible mistake with dad,3
being dishonest with him that kind of thing always pays off and now it is paying off,3
you know you know why i asked annie here right,3
you know,3
i want to ask her to marry me,3
so it is all right i will just go ahead with it,3
see then it is not just my business god you have,0
oh you infuriate me sometimes you know it is not just my business too if dad throws a fit,0
every time i reach out for something i have to pull back because other people will suffer my whole entire life time and time after time,2
to hell with that,0
i did not ask annie yet,3
i wanted to get this settled first,3
well then i guess it is over then but from her letters i think she is forgotten him,3
i will find out but then after it is all over we will thrash it out with dad right,3
because it is,3
it just is i,3
but if i cannot have that here then i will get out,3
i will get out i will marry her somewhere else maybe new york,3
yes i like it an hour out of the day if i have to grub for money all day long at least that evening i want it beautiful i want a wife i want a family i want some kids i want to build something i can give myself to,0
now annie s in the middle of all that,0
now where do i find it,3
yes on this i would,3
then help me stay here,3
okay just,3
i am thinking like that,3
no you don t i am a pretty tough guy,3
why did you invite her here,0
she is been in new york for three and a half years she do not just suddenly come and,0
you do not travel seven hundred miles just to see,0
it is got that about it,0
she is not larry s girl she knows that,0
she is faithful as a rock do not you know in my worst moments i can think of her,2
nobody in my house better ever dare dare to challenge her faith maybe strangers but not his father not his brother,0
don t do not laugh at me do not laugh at me,0
look at it because why when she came here and she slept in his room the memorial broke into pieces look at it look at it joe,0
no you have got to believe,2
you got to keep believing,2
i cannot help it,2
well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her,3
how do you know he is even thinking about it,3
well so what,3
you cannot read her mind,3
how do you know why she is waited,3
look it is a nice day what are we arguing for,3
calm yourself,3
all right all right calm yourself,0
why me above all,0
huh,0
why me above all,0
look at you you are shaking,0
what have i got to hide,0
huh what the hell s the matter with you kate,0
you are the only one i know that still loves his parents,1
no it is all right there is nothing wrong in that you know,1
it is really lovely here the air is sweet,1
no i am not sorry it s,2
well you have been embarrassed ever since i came,2
well i mean,1
from her opinion why else would i come here,1
well i guess that is why i came,1
i have been ready for a long long time,1
every day since,1
i do not know if i ever can forgive you for that why d you wait so long i sat in my room wondering if i was crazy for thinking about you,1
like larry s brother do it like you chris,1
no what is it is it your mother,2
well then tell me what is wrong i mean even in your letters there is something ashamed,2
you should tell me,2
but chris it would not work like this,2
yeah sure,2
how many,2
geez,2
and you still feel that way,2
because you cannot feel that way never again chris you hear me never i mean the money and me too,2
what am i going to do with a fortune,1
yeah i know it went out of style did not it,1
you are not sorry you came,3
well,3
what,3
oh look um well the thing is i was planning on planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so and they they take it for granted we are all set,1
i i guess that is why i asked you to come,1
oh annie,1
annie i love you,1
i love you a great deal,1
i i love you i have no imagination that is all i know how to tell it,1
i am embarrassing you i did not want to tell you it here i wanted to go somewhere that would be brand new to each other it feels wrong here do not you this yard and this chair,1
i do not want to win you from anybody i want you to be ready for me,1
you felt something that far back,1
why did not you let me know,1
give me a kiss annie,1
give me,1
we are going to live now i am going to make you so happy,1
i kissed you,1
let us drive somewhere i want to be alone with you,2
no no no no nothing like that,3
yeah i guess there is i guess i was but uh it is going from me now,2
i do not know where to start,2
you know when i went overseas i said i was in command of a company,2
well i lost them,2
just about all,2
it takes a little while to toss that off because they were not just men,2
for instance one time it had to have been raining several days there was this one kid he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket,2
i mean that s that s only a little thing but that is the kind of guys i had they did not just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly a little more selfish and they would still be here today,2
and i and i thought something watching them go down,2
everything was being destroyed see but there was one new thing that was being created a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me,2
and to show that to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him,2
and i came back here and it was incredible there was no meaning in that here the whole thing to them was a bus accident,2
and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys,2
and i felt wrong to be alive to drive the car to see the new checkbook to see the new refrigerator i mean you can take those things out of the war but you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man and you got to be a little bit better because of that,2
otherwise what you have here is loot and there is blood on it,2
and i did not want to take any of it,2
and i guess that included you,2
annie,1
annie i am going to make a fortune for you,1
fine,2
i do not understand why you are always saying oh it is mine it is mine it is not like it is just your flashlight i mean how do you think that makes me feel,0
not particularly,2
i do not know i just don t,2
pass up what a bunch of fish they swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die,0
hey what time is it they are supposed to run around midnight right god this is great is not it,1
look at the night we got could not be better,1
you know actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the the people and the lights and uh but i thought we would miss it hey how you doing,1
oh is that is that now is that just foam uhh i cannot even tell,1
oh though if i cannot tell it probably is not them right it probably would be unmistakable would not you think hey how you doing,1
oh do you know what i forgot i forgot my flashlight how could i be so stupid oh i i should have brought my flashlight,1
uh you know the flashlight the silver one there is only one is not there,1
we should have brought our flashlight i cannot believe we forgot to bring it,1
i hope the moon stays out,1
hey do they always run during a full moon i cannot remember if it was full last year do you remember,1
we should have brought the blanket oh why did not we bring the blanket our blanket,1
you know what would be good right now a six pack ah i cannot believe i forgot a six pack a six pack would be just the ticket right about now,1
i am so stupid i am like a little kid i it s amazing i get out of the house with my fly zipped oh laughter,1
i wonder if they can hear us talk or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move,1
do you want my jacket,3
right,3
yeah that is my point too,3
no no no no that is not my point my point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave,1
i mean do not you want to see it,3
why not,3
i would not miss this for anything i mean think about this okay i know you are not interested but just think about this for a minute,1
and they all all as one turned as one and formed this line as big as the california coast and started swimming this way swimming as if that is the only thing that matters,1
you know they did not ask it a question they didn t they did not take a vote they did not have an invitation or a map they just started swimming as one,1
its single mindedness with one mind urgency that is pure urge you know they do not give it a name,1
they do not ask it a question they just they just they do not know what drives them they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here,1
where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death oh god i am giving myself goosebumps look i am all all my hairs on my arms is sticking up,1
about what i just said,3
about what,3
augie goddamn it do not ask me that you always ask me that why do you ask me that i hate it it is insulting,0
like i feel like my whole life i have been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up,0
do you remember the last time we came here,2
we thought i was pregnant,2
you brought a bottle of champagne,2
we took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand under the moon,1
and you whispered so intimately in my ear so i could feel your words,1
oh that moment that was it,1
i told myself finally this is how happy i am supposed to be,2
dancing barefoot in the sand drinking out of a bottle of champagne,1
i do not want to remember something,2
hope for some things,2
no,2
no,2
no no,2
no,0
no it is not it is standing on the beach waiting and fighting,0
things have never turned out anything the way that i thought they would be,2
it is not something else do you know what i am trying to say,2
i know you are augie and i know you wanted this evening to be nice but i cannot help thinking of being somewhere else,2
i did not say that,2
well i guess we are just in the wrong spart spot with the right person,1
i noticed that it is beautiful,1
you can see right over the water,1
at least we will not need glasses,1
maybe this is the right place after all,1
i am sorry augie,2
about what i was just saying,3
carla can i ask you something do not take this wrong but are you having your period,3
we are not seeing the grunions,3
wait a minute i got it,3
a a back rub some ice cream a suicide pact what the hell do you want carla,0
actually now that you mention it no i don t,1
seemed like a pretty good spot to me i mean look at the view of the moon we have got from here,1
look what we got here,1
it is not champagne,1
are you still cold do you want to go home,3
shh,3
if we are very quiet the fish might come,1
or not,1
breathing,3
do you think it is them,3
do not laugh at me i am serious,1
oh dear well shall we want that,2
well what if happens if one of us is to die does the one that is left still laugh,2
thank you dear the same applies to you except that if i ever so much as catch you looking at another woman i will kill you,1
oh charles that was his name charles he did wiggle so beautifully,1
yeah and that was the first time you ever hit me,1
the manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers laughter,1
i know oh man could not believe it,1
we are all right are not we darling whatever happens,3
then i do not care,3
things that should matter dreadfully do not seem to matter at all when one s happy do they,1
laughter you must not be serious my dear one that is what they want,1
ooh certainly you must we are figures of fun all right,1
let us blow strumpets blow blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children let us savor the delight of the moment come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets,1
remember that awful scene we had in venice,1
that was a rouser was not it,1
just a little perhaps but it was nothing serious,3
well it is true,3

do not be so stupid,0
what,0
it is a woman s job to allure the man watch me will not you a minute,3
no it isn t,0
i do not care i do not care do you understand i do not care if they bark if they roll over on the floor like hoops,0

i guess he is,2
i do not know but i know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with dad,2
you know that larry s not coming back and i know that too why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him,0
why should not he walk around and dream at him at night walk around why should not he walk around why should not he dream of him walk around at night waiting for him do we contradict him do we say flat out that we do not have anymore hope,0
that we have not had any hope for years now,0
you know why i asked annie here right,3
i want to ask her to marry me,3
okay so then it is alright i will go ahead with it,3
oh see then it is just not my business god you infuriate me sometimes is not my business too if dad throws a fit huh god you have such a talent for ignoring things,0
well to hell with that,0
i wanted to get this settled first,3
then i guess that is the end of it,3
but from her letters i think she is forgotten him i will find out,2
and then we will thrash it out with dad right mom do not avoid me,3
i have given it three years of thought and i thought that if i waited then dad would forget about larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy,2
but if i cannot have that here i will get out,3
i will get out i will marry her somewhere else maybe new york,3
i have been a good son too long a good sucker and i am through with it,0
the business does not inspire me,0
yes i like it an hour out of the day if i have to grub for money all day long at least at evening i want it beautiful i want a family i want a wife i want some kids i want to build something i can give myself to,0
yes on this i would,3
i know just you help me stay here,2
i am thinking like that,2
no you don t i am a pretty tough guy,2
why did he invite her here,0
well she is been away for three and a half years in new york and suddenly she just shows up,0
no she is not his girl joe and she knows that,0
i mean her faith is stronger than a rock,0
my worst times i think about her you know and i,2
it is like i know as long as she is waiting i am right again,2
no nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith you know and maybe strangers but not his father not his brother,0
laugh laugh at me but i will because you know what happened when she came here when she came back she slept in his room the memorial broke into pieces joe look look at it you got to believe with me,0
look it was just last week that detroit some boy came back he had been away longer than larry you can read it for yourself you above all people have got to believe,2
i cannot help it,2
well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her,3
who said he even thought about that,3
well so what,3
how do you know why she is waited hmmm,3
alright alright calm yourself okay calm yourself wait wait what do you mean me above all,0
wait what does that mean me above all,0
look at you you are shaking,0
what do i got to hide huh what the hell s the matter with you kate,0
no i am not sorry but i am not going to stay,2
look,2
you saw the way that she acted and then well i mean you you were acting kind of,2
well i do not know embarrassed of her since i came,2
well,1
i guess that is why i came,1
look i have been ready for a long long time now,1
look i almost got married two years ago,1
you started to write me,1
every day since,1
i was waiting for you chris i mean till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say,1
you would always be so ambiguous,1
i will never forgive you for that,1
i mean why did you wait all these years there i was sitting around and wondering if i was crazy for thinking about you,1
not like that you are not,1
how many,2
geez,2
and you still feel that way,2
that includes me too i mean and the money you have right to that money your father put planes up in the air good planes and he deserves it you should be proud of that a man should be paid for that,2
what am i going to do with a fortune,1
you are not sorry you came,3
what,3
i mean that is the reason why i asked you here,1
i love you,1
you felt something that far back,1
give me a kiss ann just give me,1
oh god annie i kissed annie i kissed annie,1
we are going to live now i am going to make you so happy,1
nothing hey let us drive somewhere i want to be alone with you,2
you remember overseas i was in command of a company,2
well i lost them,2
just about all,2
takes a little while to toss that off cause they were not just men,2
for instance one time this it had been raining several days and this one kid he came up to me he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket,2
that is just a little thing but that is the kind of guys i had they did not just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly,2
a little more selfish and they would still be here today and i got this idea watching them go down see everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created,2
it was a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me,2
and to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him,2
and then i came here and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident,2
and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all,2
it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive i felt wrong to have that new checkbook,2
open that new bank account drive the new car and see the new refrigerator,2
cause you can take those things out of the war but you got to know when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that,2
otherwise what you have is loot and there is blood on it,2
and i did not want to take any of it and i guess that included you,2
annie i am going to make a fortune for you,1
buy some hats,1
yes,3
i am just not,3
hey what time is it this pokes around midnight right god this is great is not it,1
look at the night we got i would not trade this for anything,1
you know actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but i was afraid you would miss it how are you doing,1
is that is that nah is that just paul i cannot even tell,1
but if i cannot tell it probably is not them is not it probably would be unmistakable would not you think how are you doing,1
oh you know what i forgot i forgot my flashlight how could i be so stupid i should have brought my flashlight,1
god oh you know what would be good right about now a six pack a six pack would be just the ticket,1
i am so stupid i should have brought a six pack god i am like a little kid it is amazing i get out of the house with my fly zipped up oh laughter,1
i wonder if they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around,1
do you want my jacket,3
honey this is a natural phenomenon it only happens once a year i mean think about the people in kansas they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this we are only forty minutes away this is too good to pass up,1
well this is like the highlight the one night of their lives and that flopping around that is laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it,1
but this is the big night for these guys their last life s last orgy,1
yeah they do,1
okay but it is fish that do something that no other fish do like the swallows in capistrano or the lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs there is magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable,1
look is that no is that just seaweed,1
you know this is great is not it you know i would not trade this for anything,1
i mean think about this i know you are not interested but just think about this for a minute,1
somewhere out there there is this huge silver mass of fish heading this way they do not why we do not know why they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies,1
like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming this way they didn t you know they did not make a decision they didn t you know have boats or anything no one sent them an invitation or a map they just started swimming as if that is the only thing that matters,1
it is single mindedness with no mind it is urgency that is pure urge and they don t they do not ask it a question they do not give it a name they just swim,1
they just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death,1
oh i am giving myself goose bumps look all my hairs are standing up,1
breathing so what do you think,1
about what i just said,1
about what,0
it is ridiculous,0
it is pr i mean somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach,0
yeah everyone else was sold the same thing i mean look it keeps us excited it keeps us coming back for more and you know keeps us thinking life s going to start any minute now,0
look i am sorry but it is still just fish to me,0
okay twice is as many times as we have tried and that is ever,0
augie god dammit do not ask me that you always ask me that i hate it when you ask me that it is insulting,0
listen i have waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up,0
no we won t i mean god this is not about the fish augie,0
we thought i was pregnant,2
i would rather not remember something,2
rather not hope for something,2
no,2
i want things to turn out the way that they are supposed to be,0
cause everything is not anything like i thought it would be,0
this is just this you know i mean it is a lot and everything but it is not somewhere else do you know what i am trying to say,2
i know you are augie i know you wanted this evening to be nice,2
i cannot help thinking about being somewhere else,2
i did not say that,2
augie whatever i am doing i would rather be doing with you,2
if anybody wants to be with anybody else it is probably you probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard,2
well i guess this is the wrong spot for the right people,2
yeah i noticed that it is real pretty on the water,1
oh you brought refreshments,1
no i am beginning to think you might be right,1
i think this may be the place for us after all,1
i am sorry augie,1
or not,1
so what do you think,1
well we are going to see it,3
let us see i took a shower you were watching the news you said hey hey the grunions are running tonight and i said great let us go i feel lucky tonight,3
wait a minute i have got it,3
it was in the car right driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker,3
and you said let us get some champagne and i said time s a wasting or something like that,3
you want this to be like the other time right that is it right,3
welcome to the human race,0
do you think that this is what i had in mind that four years down the line that we would get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish no,0
i was just like you i thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we would have three big fat rosy kids,0
and you know baby the jokes on us because you know what you get do you know what you get carla you get this,0
yes it is,0
right,0
maybe if you were with someone else too,2
i know but i know i do not make you happy,2
i mean look at the view of the moon we got from here,1
hey look what we got here,1
shh if we are very quiet the fish might come,1
or not,1
now and always sweet,1
i mean it was it is bound to come out sooner or later,1
that sent shivers up my spine,1
behave exquisitely,1
that is serious enough,2
i do not care then,1
no wrong number,1
i did not hit you very hard,3
oh come on you knew there was nothing in that,3
presents a trivial little broach,0
no i didn t you made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination,3
just a little perhaps but nothing serious,3
well it did not harm him in fact it pleasured him a lot and it did not hurt me,3
i do not know why you want it you have already had two glasses,0
i do not see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing,0
it is become a habit with you,3
what,0
no just making myself beautiful for you,3
that is the woman s job to lure the man watch me a moment will not you,3
adders do not snap they sting,0
they sting,0
mind your business,0
you are quite insufferable i expect it is because you are drunk,0
you have always had a weak head,0
on the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy,0
shut up,0
not very funny dear in fact maybe you better have some more brandy,0
they are away in tunis,3
very well if you insist on being a boorish and idiotic,0
you are far too temperamental try to control yourself,0
go away go away i hate you,0
i hate you listen i am sick and tired of listening to you you sadistic bully,0
this is the end understand this is the end here and now forever and always,0
oh yes i am yes i am and you cannot stop me,0
listen you are a cruel fiend and i hate loathe you thank god finally finally thank god i have realized just how horrible you are and marry you marry you never i will never marry you i will die die in torment,0
beast brute cad swine beast beast brute devil sorry,0
yes the real cause of that rile was peter burden,3
you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden,0
you must admit he was in love with you,0
you let him kiss you you said so what of it,0
and what about me,0
oh that is a nice point of view i must say,0
yeah so am i bored stiff,0
you want some brandy,3
i will have a little i think,3
no particular reason anyhow they were very small ones,0
oh my just because i just okay,0
you need not be so grand just because you do not happen to want any yourself at the moment,0
actually that is perfectly true,3
yes it is,3
i think that,3
i am not in the least bit drunk,0
okay like i mentioned before i had three very small minute liquor glasses of brandy that is not even enough to get a child of two drunk,0
oh what an interesting topic what about a child of four and a child of six a child of nine,0
we might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots,0
oh thanks i think i will,0
you better turn that off,0
no i will do no such thing,0
come on turn it off it is driving me mad,0
turn it turn it off,0
very amusing indeed,0
you know what you are a vile little evil minded little wicked beast and i never want to see you again,0
you are not going nowhere no you are not,0
just shut up,0
shut up shut up i would i would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you are an evil minded little vampire and i hope to god i never see you again,0

congratulations,1
i am invited right,1
yeah i will help plan,1

i just think browns are really what you want to go with i mean i think there is more contrast between brown and green than there is,3
i know but you just asked me to,3
okay fine so green and what,3
blue,3
okay fine greens and blues,3
greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow,3
yeah,3
okay that sounds good um and uh we are going to get like a five uh story cake right,3
i mean you know you are going to have at least like two hundred and fifty people come so we are going to need you know just a huge buffet,3
fried chicken mashed potatoes,3
well i cannot be in charge of this i mean i got things i got to do,3
well this is really exciting i mean i just i could not be happier right now,1
i am thrilled god,1
just ecstatic i cannot believe you are my best friend,1
you are my best friend we are growing up and now you are getting married that is amazing,1
wow i just i i i feel like i am going to faint,1
i am so all the blood,1
has just rushed to my head and i and i mean honestly,1
i am getting a little weak in the knees,1
i do not know okay i mean gosh there is just look there is a lot of pressure in getting married okay,3
that is helpful,3
i am really good at what i do i just do not know how to make someone else see that,0
what who says that bananas do not grow overnight,0
yeah but you were not unemployed for three years trying to find any job i mean at this point i am going to go drive a cab or you know work at the gas station or something i do not even i do not know what to do anymore,0
clearly everything you are doing is completely wrong,0
i do not even i mean you have to have some kind of an idea something you could possibly throw out there that i could maybe use,0
i mean it is not like this is an,0
extreme request i want to find a job everybody wants to find a job it is really not that,0
okay okay fine,0
okey so i am doing something wrong what am i doing wrong,0
i am really good at what i do i am smart i am trained i have the education i am talented i cannot,0
well you just you are doing something wrong,0
what is my problem what is my problem i do not have a job,0
i thought i was pretty clear about what the problem was,0
well i guess you are not trying hard enough,3
just i do not know maybe you are not smart enough,3
i mean i do not know just go out and keep trying just,3
i do not know,3
hey look i mean you know,3
look bananas do not grow overnight okay,3
you need that time,3
you know you need to just you need i mean it takes time to get a good job i mean,3
look at me like you know i mean hey i it took me you know like six years to get where i am now i mean,3
i mean well i mean i do not know it does not really affect my life you know,3
yeah i understand but,3
i do not know well like i do not know i mean,3
clearly cle clearly you are doing something wrong,3
because if you have been looking you have been applying for jobs for three years and,3
are you i mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview,3
and you like you know you shave your legs and everything,3
and i want i mean you know you have got to like do your hair i mean i do not know it is like,3
you know what i mean you know it is like they say presentation is like eighty percent,3
or some some large percent of of success,3
because i do not know i mean just you know just keep keep keep at it keep trying go,3
hey i would love to help you but i you do not have the kind of training that i,3
well you have got to start somewhere i mean,3
i do not know it is like i am trying to be,3
i am trying to be helpful,3
i am trying to watch tv,3
lost it just like i mean,0
it is not like it just disappeared into thin air somebody was not paying attention,0
because my bag was very easy to keep track of it is got big you know rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it is just gone,0
no no i heard i heard what you said,0
you are kidding me right you are going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag everything that was in it the inconvenience that i have gone through i paid for my ticket all i expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff is that so much to ask i mean i really do not think that is that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where i leave and then put my bag where i end up,0
yeah well that is got everything i have in it,0
look fifty dollars is unacceptable my bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars you cannot just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that s that is good enough like that is all i needed was fifty dollars my bag is worth more than that,0
i expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it,0
i did not sign anything i did not sign anything and you people have got to make,0
you have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff fifty dollars is unacceptable,0
no no i do not know you know what i am going to call my lawyer you know what that is what i am going to do i am going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option,0
i want to talk to your supervisor,0
i have had enough i want to talk to no no unacceptable i want to your supervisor i am done with this,0
really you do not work for anybody it is just you,0
okay well i want to call whoever you report to whoever your boss is because i have had enough with this airline and i am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate,0
thanks,2
you know it is just i just you know i mean it just happened i just like i just keep expecting him to walk in you know,2
i just i just thought he would have longer you know because i m i mean when he found out he was sick we knew that was not good but i just i just thought that it would take longer you know,2
yeah i know i know,2
yeah i know but i would rather have him here with me you know it is just not fair i mean he he did not get to do like anything i mean he was,2
he was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do you know and now he will not get to do them and he will not get to be here when i do you know like i will get married some day and he will not be there like he will not get to see that,2
it just does not seem fair,2
thank you for being here,2
laughter you are probably right he probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it he would want us to have a party,1
and to drink in his honor laughter,1
yeah i know,2
hey i m uh i am really sorry about what happened i do not um i mean what you can you do i mean it s,2
when i was seven my my grandmother died and i really i do not know i mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is is that you do let go and your realize that you know they you know they this person had fun while they were while they were here and uh you know you work you work through it,2
mmhmm yeah yeah i mean it s it is hard it is hard,2
yeah,2
well i mean you know i mean it was i mean with that kind of condition,3
you know it is inevitable and i mean honestly it s it is almost like,2
you know you don t you know how long do you want the person to go through that you know,3
it is sort of it is almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain,3
yeah,2
it is not fair but i mean that s you know the course of life is that you know you meet people and you lose them,2
you are okay,2
you know i think i think we should celebrate because i think that is what he would have wanted,2
yeah,3
that is right that is right i mean he would want us to you know celebrate the life that he that he lived and you know enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can,2
so,2
guess what came today,1
my acceptance letter,1
from u s c,1

that is awesome,1
oh that is right okay i see right right right,3

well that is really cool that you are going to be staying in the same city and everything so umm,1

dorky,3
it is important,3
fine it is dorky,3
but that ll fit you because you are a dork,3
i dork,1
yeah you do not want to do the sorority thing because you will probably get used and abused by,3
lots of drunk frat boys,3
yeah,3
i mean it is not really free because you have to pay for it but yeah,3
well do you think you are going to live on campus or off campus your first year,3
i hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool so,3
no no no you are right though i mean you know dorms are definitely the way to meet people i know that i was in an apartment off campus,3
that happened you know that was going on,3
hello thank you for calling dell taco corporate can i help you,1

sir can can you tell me which branch you went to we can start there,3
okay um and what was the complaint,3
can you be a little more specific sir,3
well i am very sorry sir they should have dealt with it at that particular branch i apologize for that uh but we can help you that is no worries we can take care of that so how much did you need to be refunded,3
okay um i am going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department they will need your address,3
but i am giving you what you want,0
um i basically um i i ordered some food,3
it was a hundred a sixty dollars i am sorry uh sixteen dollars,3
look i do not want to be transferred over to another all i want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check,0
okay you understand that is all i want just do not give me a problem with this okay please because i am very sensitive right now,0
and if i get sent to another operator i will have to tell them the same damn story again i don t i think i am just going to lose my mind so if you could please just not do that that would be great thank you,0
you do not understand because you have never gone to del taco and gotten the service that i have gotten you do not understand,0
you are not going to call the other operator you are not going to call the the other operator,0
you are going to fill out a form on your desk,0
because i know you are at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you are going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents,0
cindy cindy what,0
cindy look if you do not get your ass a piece of paper that has a check,0
attached to it and you do not send it to me i am going to get very upset,0
did you talk to him,2
what do you want to do argue with him,0
you cannot say that to him,0
how are you going to prove it can you prove it,0
to you it is and to me but not to him you can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you,0
the trouble is the goddamn newspapers every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be larry,0
well that is only your business chris,3
what do you want me to do you are old enough to know your own mind,0
i ignore what i got to ignore the girl is larry s girl,0
from father s point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl,0
now you can go on from there and you know where to go but i am telling you i do not know where to go see i do not know now what can i do for you,0
you are a considerate fellow there is nothing wrong in that,3
i do not see why it has to be annie,0
well that is a good answer but it do not answer anything you have not seen her since you went to war it is been five years,0
you marry that girl you are pronouncing him dead now what happens to your father do you know because i don t,0
are you crazy,0
you have got a business here what the hell is this,0
must you be inspired,0
alright but do not think that way,0
because what the hell did we work for this whole shooting match is just for you chris,0
but do not think that way you hear me,0
yeah i can see that,0
he saw it,3
no i figured the best thing was to leave him alone,2
i could hear him right through the floor of my room,2
you know that larry s not coming back and i know it why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him,0
i do not want to argue with him but it is time that he realizes that larry s not coming back anymore,0
we have got to say it to him,0
for god s sake three years nobody comes back after three years it is insane,0
you know why,3
i am going to ask her to marry me,3
then it is not just my business,0
sometimes you infuriate me you know that is not it your business too if i tell this to father and he throws a fit about it,0
sometimes you have a sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things,0
to hell with that,0
i wanted to get this settled first,2
and then we will thrash it out with dad right mom do not avoid me,0
so what i am not fast with women,0
because it is,0
these years when i think of someone for my wife i think of annie what do you want a diagram,2
i have given it three years of thought i hoped that if i waited dad would forget about larry,0
the business the business does not inspire me,0
why did he invite her,0
it is been three years why all of a sudden,0
what is going on here joe,0
no line,0
she is not his girl joe she knows she is not,0
then why is she still single new york is full of men why has not she married,0
probably a hundred people told her she is foolish but she is waited,0
because she knows what i know that is why she is faithful as a rock,0
she goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces look look at it joe,0
why does that bother you,3
well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again,3
how do you know he is even thinking about it,3
uh then why is she still she s not his girl joe,3
you cannot read her mind,3
what does that mean me above all look at you you are shaking,0
i guess this is why i came,1
chris i have been ready a long long time,1
you started to write me,1
every day since,1
i was waiting for you chris till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say i mean you sure can be ambiguous you know,1
i will never forgive you why did you wait all these years all i have done is sit and wonder if i was crazy for thinking of you,1
yeah sure,3
how many,2
what will i do with a fortune,1
what,0
i guess you know this is why i asked you to come,3
ann i love you i love you a great deal i love you,1
i have no imagination that is all i know to tell you,1
i am embarrassing you i did not want to tell it to you here i,1
and he is gone forever you are sure,3
give me a kiss ann give me a god i kissed you,1
i kissed annie how long how long i have been waiting to kiss you,1
annie we are going to live now i am going to make you so happy,1
no nothing like that,2
yes i suppose i have been but it is going from me,2
there is so many things mixed up,2
you remember overseas i was in command of a company,2
well i lost them,2
just about all,2
it takes a lot of time to toss that off because they were not just men,2
for instance one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks,2
i put them in my pocket that is only a little thing but these are the kind of guys i had,2
they did not die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly a little more selfish and they would have been here today,2
and i got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made,2
a sort of responsibility man for man you understand me,2
and then i came home and it was amazing,2
i felt what you said ashamed somehow,2
because nobody was changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys,2
i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book to drive the new car to see the new refrigerator,2
when you drive the new car you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man you have got to be a little better because of that,2
otherwise what you have is really just loot and there is blood on it i did not want to take any of it,2
i guess that included you,2
annie annie i am going to make a fortune for you,1
fine,3
it is after eleven let us go home,0
there is no point in coming down here,0
i just don t it is stupid,0
pass up what these little fish swim onto the beach flop around and then swim away and then they die,0
what are you so excited about this is not a moon landing we are talking about it is fish it is fish nobody even eats,0
i am just not,0
yes,0
we did not see them the first time either,0
about what,0
it is ridiculous,0
what time is it they are supposed to run around midnight this is great is not it look at this night we have got here it could not be better,1
is that is that that s just foam is not it i cannot even tell,1
i hope the moon stays out i wonder do they always run during a full moon i cannot remember if it was full last year remember,1
are you cold do you want my jacket we should have brought the blanket our blanket,3
ah this is great is not it i did not even think to bring a six pack a six pack would be just the ticket right about now,1
that is my point too,3
think about the people in kansas they would have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this we are just forty minutes away it is too good to pass up,1
this is the big night for these guys life s last orgy,1
like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs like that there is mystery here and magic,1
we just were not in a good spot this is a much better spot,0
i have got good instincts for these things look there what is that is that is that is that no it is just seaweed is not it,1
ah man this is great i would not miss this for anything i mean think about this i know you are not interested but just think about this for a minute,1
out there someplace there is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way they do not know why we do not know why it was not a decision they did not take a vote,1
no one sent them a map or an invitation just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one they turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming,1
they are swimming right now as if that is the only thing that matters,1
it is single mindedness with no mind urgency that is pure urge,1
they do not know what drives them they do not give it a name or ask question they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,1
where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death,1
ah i am giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up,1
it is pr somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach,0
goddamn it augie do not ask me that you always ask me that i hate it when you ask me that it is insulting,0
we just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like,0
for heaven s sake this is not about fish,0
we totally skipped right,3
for heaven s sake grow up we are not going to see the grunions,0
we never do do we have we ever,0
twice is every time we have tried that is ever,0
and the fish will not show up,0
we thought i was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses you asked me to dance so we took off our shoes,2
and you popped the cork and while we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me,2
right into my ear so that i could hear them as much as so that i could feel them as much as hear them,2
and i remember thinking this is it at last at last i am as happy as i am supposed to be,2
dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle,2
i would rather not remember some things i would rather not hope for some things,2
no,3
no,2
no,0
this what what is this this is not even anything,0
oh right sure this is standing on the beach this is waiting this is fighting,0
i know you are augie really i do i know you wanted this to be special and nice and it is the full moon and the sand and all but i just could not help thinking about being somewhere else,2
somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and did not take everything so hard,2
yeah i noticed that looks pretty on the water does not it big old white moon,1
oh augie you brought refreshments,1
well then i guess we do not need glasses,1
i am beginning to think you might be right i think this may be the spot after all augie i am sorry,1
well so what do you think,3
wait a minute i have got it,3
it was in the car right driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker you said let us get some champagne and i said times a wasting or something like that right,3
that is it right you want this to be like the other time right that is it,1
you want me to get some champagne,3
maybe if you were with somebody else too,2
no i know but still i know i do not make you happy,2
actually now that you mention it no i don t,3
i do not know it seemed like a good spot to me,3
well look at what we got here,1
it is not champagne,3
ahh it sent shivers up my spine,1
behave exquisitely,1
certainly i shall probably do a court curtsy,1
it is true the whole business is very poor joke,1
do not laugh at me i am serious,1
who is they,3
oh how long will it last this ludicrous over bearing love of ours,1
what happens if one of us dies does the one that is left still laugh,3
thank you dear the same applies to you except that if i catch you so much as looking at another woman i will kill you,1
which particular one,1
oh charles that was his name charles he did wriggle so beautifully,1
yes i know you did you threw him out of the window into the grand canal i do not think i will ever forgive you for that,1
it burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom,1
then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers,1
how ridiculous how utterly utterly ridiculous,1
and very much sillier,1
what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us,1
with the most perfect poise,1
things that ought to matter dreadfully do not matter at all when one s happy do they,1
do not say that my darling,3
well who knows,3
do you remember that awful scene in venice,3
the one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed,3
horrible thing i hated it,3
how long did that row last,3
the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown,3
what of it,0
it is become a habit with you,0
oh do not be so stupid,0
what,0
it does not seem to have worked such wonders with you,0
adders do not snap they sting,0
they sting,0
i do not care okay do you understand i do not care i do not mind if they bark and roll about like hoops,0
yes i did quite a lot,0
mind your own business,0
you are quite insufferable i expect it is because you are drunk,0
you always had a weak head,0
on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy,0
oh shut up,0
not very funny dear you would better have some more brandy,0
why,0
there is no one upstairs it is a photographer s studio,0
very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic,0
you are far too temperamental try to control yourself,0
go away go away i hate you,0
listen listen indeed i am sick and tired of listening to you you damn sadistic bully,0
stop,0
stop stop i hate you do you hear you are conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible,0
this is the end do you understand the end,0
finally and forever,0
oh i am let go of me,0
oh i hate you it is a good thing that i found out in time what you are really like marry you again never never never,0
i would rather die in torment beast brute calf swine,0
as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden,3
i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him,0
you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden,0
you let him kiss you you said you did,0
what of it,0
what about me,0
that is a nice point of view i must say,0
i will have some myself i think,3
really amanda,0
nothing,0
going somewhere my dear,0
did you see much of peter burden after our divorce,3
i am not in the least drunk,0
very good idea i will,0
there are people downstairs i suppose,0
this is no time of year for tunis,0
turn it off it is driving me mad,0
amanda listen,0
very amusing,0
you are a vile tempered loose living wicked little beast and i hope i never see you again as long as i live,0
you are not going like this,0
you are not,0
shut up shut up i would not marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees,0
you are a mean evil minded little tempered witch i hope to god i never set eyes on you again as long as i live whore,0
okay what is the problem,3
okay um do you have your photo id with you,3

it is fantastic i congratulations it is amazing,1
this is why men do not plan weddings laughter,1
all fruit and brown laughter,1
yeah it is pretty amazing huh,1
well i did not want it to be like cheesy you know,1
she did not cry but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting so,1
honestly it was kind of quickly it was actually only in the past couple months,1
yeah yeah so i know i know i know it is weird because it is like the beginning of the rest of my life you know,1
but uh no i mean you know you know i really want you to like you know sort of,1
okay well there you go,1
barefoot,1
yeah but i am really excited so and everybody s going to come out and it will be a great time and,1
it is big and shiny i do not know it is silver and,1
yeah i do not know laughter but yeah so anyway well i wanted to tell you that you know because you are one of my good friends and you are kate s one of her best friends and,1
yeah yeah she was actually she was going to tell you but i told her that i wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway so i decided to,1
yeah yeah,1
thank you i am really i am really excited and it is i do not know it is like a little it is like a little scary because i am like ah you know it is the first time i have ever done anything like this,1
but you know it is like i really love her and i really just i cannot imagine spending my life with anybody else but her so you know it is like i know that is the right thing and if you have to you know if you have to question that you know don t do not do it so we are going to do it,1
and it is going to the you know i told her that i just i want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding and um maybe some greens and blues,1
she is okay with it,1
well i mean i just told her well i just said you know hey these are my suggestions,1
all fruit and the color brown just that that is all that is my only request,1
yeah well maybe maybe you are right maybe there is something to that,1
so um anyway do you want to order now so um i mean,3
well there has to be something you have not tried,3
what about like a temp agency,3
have you gone like signed up with a temp agency maybe they can help,3
right but you have i mean you have to keep on them you have to keep calling and reminding them that you are still looking and,3
i mean you have to be really aggressive about it,3
well i mean if it is that bad maybe you are gonna have to take something that does not really fit you know like maybe you will have to do something else for a while find a new field new skill,3
well then you are choosing to be unemployed really,3
if you are not willing to try and work with it and find something and you know i mean there are things you could do,3
well maybe you know your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while,3
i mean i am not saying that you should you know,3
it is my fault because you did not do what i told you to,3
well that sounds like your fault,3
you did not do what i told you to do,3
i think maybe you cannot get employed because you are not willing to take responsibility for your own actions,3
really whose fault is it you do not have a job,3
laughter,3
there is just like no jobs available i mean it is just like god,3
well i mean it makes sense does not it hmm,3
that is not true i take responsibility for my own actions,3
yours i don t,3
hi how can i help you,3
mmhmm,3
i am sorry,3
right,3
uh okay i first of all i am very sorry you lost your bag,3
um but actually our policy is a fifty dollar,3
refund coverage of the bag that was lost yes,3
that is our policy sir,3
i cannot do that,3
we will cover fifty,3
i am very sorry i understand you are upset you just got off a long flight,3
i understand that i would know if it was mine um,3
but it is not it is yours i understand,3
i understand you are frustrated but,3
i know i understand it is personal it is personal to you i get that,3
fifty dollars,0
fifty dollars no way no,0
i do not but the thing is i do not care about your policy,0
you understand,0
no no because look i do not care what your policy says i mean,0
you understand that the contents of my bag the contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars,0
you,0
no no no what i need you to do i need you to write checks for i need you to write three of them that ll be satisfactory,0
just you can fill out the form we can fill out no no no we can fill out the form three times,0
yeah if it was yours but it is not it is mine okay so just,0
but i need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen,0
please,0
i am already calm okay i am calm i am calm,0
yeah if you were really sorry you would give me the three checks,0
so why do not we just do that and stop this nonsense hmm hmm,0
hey how you doing,2
i am sorry,2
i know i know there is nothing i can say that will really help but,2
i am sorry it is never easy,2
but i am here if there is anything you need i mean you just have to ask i know,2
it does not really do anything but,2
i know it never is,2
how s um how is his parents doing,2
i mean what do you want to do do you want to do you want to talk about it do you,2
well i know it is not a lot of help or anything but at least you got to know him i mean at least you had the time with him that you did,2
i mean we can be grateful for that,2
you feel that way now because you are upset but you do not really think that,2
it will get better i know it does not help but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you will be grateful for those,2
i agree if i knew how to make that happen i would certainly help you,2
when is the service can can we help is there anything i mean,2
seems like if the whole world s sad then it is okay for you to be,2
i know,2
i do not have any magic answers but,2
i mean as as cliche as it is as long as people who loved him remember him then it is not a waste you know,2
thanks,2
i know i just i do not know it is just weird because you have somebody who s you know,2
a major part of your life and then they are gone and i do not know that is not really it is never really happened to me before,2
yeah,2
thanks,2
i just it is just not fair,2
i mean they re you know they are upset it is like you know they,2
feel the same way everybody else does,2
breathing i mean there is nothing really to talk about he is gone and i will never see him again,2
yeah,2
yeah i do not know sometimes i wish i did not know him so i wouldn t,2
this is just this is a terrible life i just do not understand,2
i mean it is just not fair like i do not know why people,2
there should just be some sort of rule that people do not die until they are older because then at least it is expected,2
i do not know what to do,2
i mean you you can go i do not know i do not know what else,2
i hope it rains somehow that ll make me feel more comfortable,2
yeah,2
i just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically,2
just you know some thing some genie i need to find a genie bottle,2
i know,2
i did not even,1
know you applied to u s c,1
that is amazing i have seen it on tv um wow i mean well what are you going to major in what are you going to do,1

alright take care,3
what is he going to say maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it,3
he is getting just like after he died what is the meaning in that,2
you cannot say that to him,0
how are you going to prove it can you prove it,0
to you it is and to me but not to him you can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you,0
why,3
well that is only your business chris,3
what do you want me to do you are old enough to know your own mind,0
well you want to make sure your father is not going to have,3
i ignore what i got to ignore the girl is larry s girl,0
from father s point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl,0
how do you know she will marry you maybe she feels the same way father does,3
the trouble is you do not see enough women you never did,3
i do not see why it has to be annie,0
yes we did do you want to keep going,3
just give it some more thought,3
what the hell is this,0
are you crazy,0
you have got a business here what the hell is this,0
must you be inspired,0
you do not want to think like that,0
alright but just do not think like that because what the hell did we work for that is all for you chris the whole shooting match is just for you,0
but do not think that way you hear me,0
he saw it,3
he was out here when it broke,3
we have gotta say it to him,0
for god s sake three years nobody comes back after three years it is insane,0
going to ask her to marry me,3
well then you know it is not only my business,0
sometimes you infuriate me you know that is not it your business too if i tell this to father and he throws a fit about it you have such a talent for ignoring things,0
i wanted to get this settled first,3
alright then mom did we skip something no alright then mom,3
yeah let us keep going,3
father forgot about larry we would have a regular wedding and everything happy if i cannot get that here then i will have to get out,2
the business the business does not inspire me,0
yes i like getting an hour a day if i have to grub for money all day long at least at evening i want it beautiful,0
yes on this i would,3
then you help me stay here,3
why did he invite her here,0
why does that bother you,3
she is been in new york three and a half years why all of a sudden,0
nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see,0
he is not going to marry her,0
it is got that about it,0
what is going on here joe,0
now listen kid now listen,3
she is not his girl joe she knows she is not,0
then why is she still single new york is full of men why has not she married probably a hundred people told her she is foolish but she is waited,0
because she knows what i know that is why she is faithful as a rock in my worst moments i think of her waiting and i know again that i am right,0
nobody in this house dares take her faith away joe strangers might but not his father not his brother,0
i want you to act like he is coming back both of you do not think i have not noticed you since he invited her here i will not stand for any nonsense,0
because if he is not coming back i will kill myself,0
laugh laugh at me but why did that happen the very night that she came here,0
she goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces look look at it joe,0
believe with me joe i cannot stand all alone,0
you above all have got to believe you,0
i cannot help it,2
oh god line,3
how do you know he is even thinking about it,3
well so what,3
line,3
what have i got to hide what the hell is the matter with you kate,0
every day since,1
i was waiting for you chris til then you never wrote and when you did what did you say you sure can be ambiguous you know,1
i will never forgive you why did you wait all these years all i have done is sit around and wonder if i was crazy for thinking of you,1
how many,2
oh gees,2
what will i do with a fortune,1
yes i suppose there has been but it is going from me,2
i do not know where to start,2
it is all mixed up with so many other things you remember overseas i was in command of a company,2
well i lost them,2
just about all,2
it takes a little time to toss that off because they were not just men,2
for instance one time it would been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket that is only a little thing but that is the kind of guys i had,2
and i got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see but to me it seemed there was one new thing that was made,2
a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me and then i went home and it was incredible,2
there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident then i went to work for dad and that whole rat race again i felt what you said ashamed somehow,2
because nobody was changed it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive,2
to open that bank book to drive the new car to see the new refrigerator i mean you can take these things out of a war but when you drive the new car you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man,2
you have to be a little better because of that otherwise we have is really loot and there is blood on it i do not want to take any of it i guess that included you,2
annie annie i am going to make you a fortune,1
fine,3
it is not yours,0
it is ours it is mine too,0
you kept saying my flashlight as if it is somehow just yours how is that supposed to make me feel,0
yes,0
it is after eleven let us go home,0
there is no point in coming down here,0
so let us go home,0
i just don t it is stupid,0
pass up what these little fish swim onto the beach flop around and then they swim away and then they die,0
what are you so excited about,3
yes,0
last year you will also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties we got into a big fight over nothing you got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions,0
actually i wanted to go a little farther up the coast get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid we would miss it how you doing,1
is that is that is that just foam i cannot even tell although if you cannot tell it is probably is not them it will probably be unmistakable do not you think,1
how you doing oh no you know what i did i forgot to bring my flashlight how could i be so stupid i should have brought my flashlight,1
whose is it,3
i wonder do they always run during a full moon i cannot remember if it was full last year remember,1
are you cold do you want my jacket we should have brought the blanket our blanket,3
you want my jacket,3
right,3
that is my point too,3
honey this is a natural phenomenon i mean this only happens once a year it is a great opportunity think about the people in kansas they would have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this we are just forty minutes away it is too good to pass up,1
there is mystery here and magic,1
oh it is a big night for these guys uh life s last orgy,1
yeah they do okay but it is fish who do something none of the other fish do like the swallows are returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs like that,1
there is mystery here and magic a little bit of the unexplainable i do not see how you can not be interested,1
no it is just seaweed is not it oh man this is great i would not miss this for anything i mean think about this i know you are not interested but just think about this for a minute,1
out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way they do not know why we do not know why it was not a decision they did not take a vote no one sent them an invitation or a map,1
just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one they turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming,1
they are swimming right now as if that is the only thing that matters it is single mindedness with no mind urgency that is pure urge,1
they do not know what drives them they do not give it a name or ask a question they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death oh man i am giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up,1
well so what did you think,1
look at this goose bumps,3
goddamn it augie do not ask me that i hate it when you ask me that you always ask me that it is insulting,0
we just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like,0
we never do do we have we ever,0
i did want to see it i always do i keep thinking this time will be the time but it never is,0
it was about four years ago right after we got married we thought i was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses you asked me to dance so we took off our shoes and you popped the cork,2
dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle,2
i would rather not remember some things i would rather not hope for some things,2
no,2
no,2
no,0
i want something to turn out the way it is supposed to,0
this what what is this this is not even anything,0
oh right sure this is standing on the beach this is waiting this is fighting,0
but this is not anything like i thought anything would be like,0
i did not say that,2
okay fine so we are in the wrong spot but we are with the right person,1
yeah i noticed that looks pretty on the water does not it big ol white moon i am sorry augie,1
well so what d you think,3
what i said,3
well what is bugging you,0
there is nothing to it we come down here the grunions arrive they do their little fish business we go ooh ah look at the fish they go home we go home,0
wait a minute i have got it,3
it was in the car right driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker you said let us get some champagne and i said times a wasting or something like that right that is it right you want this to be like the other time that is it of course,3
well welcome to the human race you think this is what i had in mind you think that when i proposed i had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we would come to the beach and yell at each other over fish no,0
and we will have three fat rosy kids and ha ha ha baby the joke s on us because you know what you get carla you know what you get this,0
no i know me neither,0
no i know but still i know i do not make you happy,2
actually now that you mention it no i don t,1
i do not know it seemed like a good spot to me i mean look at the view you have got of the moon from here,1
shh if we are very quiet the fish might come,1
oh it sent shivers up my spine,1
behave exquisitely,1
certainly i shall probably do a court curtsey,1
but what is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy,1
it is true the whole business is a very poor joke,1
who is they,1
if i laugh at everything i must laugh at us too,3
how long will it last this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours,1
shall we always want to bicker and fight,1
what happens if one of us dies does the one that is left still laugh,1
well that is serious enough is not it,1
thank you dear the same applies to you except that if i catch you so much as looking at another woman i will kill you,1
which particular one,1
oh charles that was his name charles oh he did wriggle so beautifully,1
i know you did you threw it out of the window into the grand canal i do not think i will ever forgive you for that,1
it went on intermittently for days,1
it burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom,1
that was the first time you ever hit me,1
the manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers oh dear,1
how ridiculous how utterly utterly ridiculous,1
and very much sillier,1
we will be alright darling whatever happens are not we,3
i do not care then,1
what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us,1
with the mo with the most perfect poise,1
meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love,3
you must not be serious my dear that is just what they want,3
all the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable laugh at them be flippant laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths flippancy brings out the acid acid in their damn sweetness and light,0
no that fire will fade along with our passion,2
let us savor the delight of the moment come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets,1
horrible thing i hated it,0
line,3
how that was a rouser was not it,1
as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden,3
that was the first time you ever hit me,0
the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers oh dear,1
how ridiculous how utterly utterly ridiculous,1
and very much sillier,1
not at all it was very pretty i still have it and i wear it often,1
just a little perhaps nothing serious,1
let him kiss you,3

i do not care do you understand i do not care i do not mind if they bark and roll about like hoops,0
yes i did quite a lot,0
mind your own business,0
you are quite insufferable i expected it is because you are drunk,0

well of course not but what are you going to do if you move back home are you going to be able to find a job there,3
i went to school and i got my degree and i got a job,3
nothing s impossible,3
you have to be willing you have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up and,3
no it does not pay the bills but it would pay something and it would help you get somewhere else,3
and no i understand but you have got to start somewhere it is better than nothing and that is all you have you have nothing right now,3
wait you can move up there is management programs in mcdonalds and things like that,3
garbage no i wouldn t but i,3
well you know what life gets humili humiliating at times,3

well just do not give up and there s you know you never know something might be around the corner tomorrow,3
well you know i am not going to let you starve,3
it is the way it seems to me you started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and did not find a job and i am not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything it is just that,3
well exactly money is not everything,3
you know i would never let that happen i would not let that happen,3

putting your best foot forward or you,3
do they seem to like you i mean can you get any read from them,3
have you ever called them back and asked why you did not get the job,3

everyone wants to be a working actor but they all work at something else,3
so what is the something else,3
you cannot get a catering gig well i can call some friends i well i did call some friends before but you went in once and then never went back,3

well i cannot leave without it i mean could you find out,3
um it is a travel backpack it is green and gray it is got my name on it and my information,3

no but i mean like why can t why cannot you find it where did it go who lost it,0
well i just i paid so much money for this ticket i feel like you guys should be able to get to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher,0
yeah meaning i did not die in a fiery plane crash how convenient but um i paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline and i would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place,0
right but part of the agreement is that i am paying so that i can take myself and my belongings with me,0
and that you are going to transport them safely from one place to another,0
that is all you can offer me i mean my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar,0
i do not believe that for a second,0
what do you mean as you can who makes up these rules,0
you are an autono autonomous human being you could you could go into the com,0
no i do not think i am i like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me and i brought it you know from africa it is not like i can just go back and get it whenever i want,0
it is not like i can go to kmart and buy another,0
okay what flight were you on,3
on what airline,3
from london okay um and you went through all your proper checkpoints,3
so you have not seen your bags since africa you flew threw heath row to here,3
okay well let me see here i,3
it seems like it went through heath row i see it here uh,3
but uh i do not see it here in the airport yet uh,3
i am not sure where it is we can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you,3
well i am not a miracle worker i do not know what i can do for you i do not have the bag right here,3
well as i told you it left heath row and it seems to have arrived here but if you cannot find it then are you sure you know what your bag looks like,3
okay and what is that what kind of bag is it,3
are you sure,3
all right now um it is green travel bag you could not find it and was there something important in it that you need it,3
sentimental value,3
right well i do not know what to tell you um what i can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight,3
no i understand i mean it is got to be tough all those sentimental things but um this is all i can do for you,3
well you know sometimes that s really i mean what else could we do,3

well my hands are really tied then,3
well it is like any kind of insurance you don t when you get it then you get more you know like if you,3
well of course not because you have got your backpack with you the whole time now if you you said this was a travel bag why were not you carrying it on if it was so important,3
uh so it was really heavy,3
i am sorry ma am there is nothing else i can do my hands are really tied here i really wish there was something else i could do for you,3
well i do not know why you would not believe that,3
well i have no way to give you more money i am giving you as much money as i can and figuring as far as figuring out where you bag is,3
makes up,3
the airline makes these rules mom ma am,3

you have a wonderful day,3
a good friend of mine passed away the other day,2
oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,2
metastasized and it was old and they knew that it was not looking good but,2
yeah we were pretty close,2
breathing,2
kind of,2
it is hard to watch when it is painful for them you know,2
i just i do not know,2
i know,2
and he could of he was pretty awesome,2
uh we grew up together,2
yeah he kind of did a lot of things but we acted together sometimes,2
i feel really bad for his family you know,2
it must be really really hard to lose a child,2
yeah and they were really supportive like through the whole process but,2
breathing,2
i cannot imagine what his what his parents are going through,2
yeah i am just going to miss him,2
thank you,2
yeah they are going to do some sort of memorial service or something,2
thanks,2
it is really bizarre you know when you know somebody really well and then,2
something happens and they die and it is like,2
really hard to imagine that like you are going to continue to live and that person s just going to have stopped,2
breathing,2
yeah,2
it is hard to say good bye,2
breathing,2
yeah yeah,2
oh no i am so sorry what happened,2
that is the worst i am so sorry did you know him well,2
i am so sorry it s,2
it is the worst when they go like that garbage was he young,2
absolutely absolutely,2
it is the think,2
there is no reason for it,2
yeah what d he do what did they do how did you know him,2
yeah,2
is he an actor too or,3
yes of course of course,2
was he very close to his family,3
yeah,3
of course not you have no idea what it is like to lose a kid,2
is there a funeral planned or,3
cool well if you want me to go with you i will,3
no problem,3
right it just does not make any sense it is not real it does not feel real,2
yeah,3
do you know what it is going to pass eventually i mean it will never pass it will always be there and you will always remember and everything like that but you know it will get easier i guess,3
that is the best way to put it,3
absolutely,3
do you know what if it was me that died i would really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way so i think you should definitely do this because it is trying what it is supposed to be,3

okay so where okay all right so where did you uh locate your your bill,3
in the mail,3

okay,3
okay,3
okay so i will just look it up and you know see what is going on maybe we can,3
if i call it up on the screen,3
so in the database it looks as though um there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it had not gone through before but i do see that you paid the what can you tell me the amount what was the amount,3
okay i do see that on here and it says that um it had some trouble clearing for some reason and i think that was the problem on our end so um,3
well you know sometimes just with online transactions things happens so um,3
yeah we somebody went in and and cleared the problem and it looks like you are all paid,3
you do the direct the direct it um it is taking right out of your bank account correct,3
yeah so that that did go through,3
um i can try to do that for you certainly,3
right right and since yeah since it was just a computer glitch then that is that should be cleared up as well so i am going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer and if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you have been charged and an overdue fee then you should just call back and we will have that,3
well i will give you my direct line and my number so you can you can get directly to me,3
yeah,3
no problem,3
ahh one eight hundred three two three,3

what is he going to say maybe we should tell him before he sees it,2
did you talk to him,2
he cried hard,2
he is thinking about him again,2
it is getting just like after larry died he is having dreams he is walking around at night,2
what is the meaning of that,2
well i got an idea but what is the story,3
well you are a considerate fellow there is nothing wrong with that,3
have you asked annie yet to marry you,3
well how did you know that she will go along with it i mean maybe she feels the same way as your father,3
the trouble is you do not see enough women you never have,3
well i just do not see why it has to be annie,3
you marry his girl and you are pronouncing him dead now what is going to happen to your father do you know i don t,2
what the hell is this,0
are you crazy,0
all right but do not think like that because i mean what the hell did we do all this for chris the whole business it is all for you the whole shooting match is for you,0
he saw it,2
he was out here when it broke,2
around four this morning and there was a crack and i looked out we are standing right there when i cracked,2
i do not know but when it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen,2
no i figured it was best to leave him alone,2
i could hear him right through the floor of my room,2
i guess he is,2
i do not know the meaning of it but i know one thing mom did we made a terrible mistake with dad,2
being dishonest with him it is the kind of thing that pays off and now it is paying off,2
you know that larry s not coming back and i know it so why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him,2
for god s sake mom three years nobody comes back after three years it is insane,0
you know why i asked annie here do not you,2
i am going to ask her to marry me,3
to hell with that,0
the business the business it does not inspire me,0
she is been in new york three and a half years why all of the sudden,3
she is not his girl she knows she is not,0
i want you to pretend like he is coming back,0
because if he is not coming back then i will kill myself,0
laugh laugh at me but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces,0
only last week another boy turned up in detroit been missing longer than larry you read it yourself,0
you have got to believe you have got to,2
i cannot help it,0
why does that bother you,3
well maybe maybe she just wanted to see her again,3
what did you mean he lived next door to the girl all of his life why would not he want to see her again do not look at me like that he did not tell me any more than he told you,3
what do you mean me above all look at you you are shaking,0
what have i got to hide what the hell is the matter with you kate,0
you are the only one i know who loves his parents,1
no it is good,1
it is so lovely here the air is sweet,1
no but i am not going to stay,1
well sort of embarrassed soon as i came,2
well from her point of view why else would i come,3
i guess this is why i came,1
i will never forgive you why did you wait so long all this time i have been wondering if i was a fool for thinking of you,1
not like that you are not,1
like larry s brother do it like you chris chris what is the matter,1
it would not work like this,2
yeah sure,3
how many,2
oh gee,2
do you still feel like that,3
because you cannot feel like that anymore chris you hear me i mean everything that you have you deserve and that includes me and your father your father put hundreds of planes in the air you should be proud a man should be paid for that,2
what would i do with a fortune,1
i know it is going out of style is not it,1
what,3
well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so but uh they take it for granted that we are all set,1
how did you know,3
anne i love you i love you a great deal i love you,1
i i i have no imagination that is all i know what to say i i m embarrassing you i i did not want to tell you here i wanted it to be some place different some place where we could be new to each other you know,1
you feel it is wrong here do not you this yard this chair i want you to be ready for me annie i do not want to win you away from anything,1
oh god i kissed annie i cannot believe i kissed annie how long i have wanted to do this,1
oh annie we are going to live now i am going to make you so happy,1
yeah i suppose i have been but it is going from me,2
it s it is mixed up with so many other things i,2
remember when i was overseas i was in command of the company,2
yeah i lost them,2
just about all,2
takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they were not just men,2
for instance there is this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks you know he just put them in my pocket,2
i know that that is not a big thing but it is just the kind of guys i had they did not die they they killed themselves for each other,2
i mean that exactly that a little more selfish and they would have still been here today,2
and i got an ideal watching them all go down everything was being destroyed see and,2
but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time a kind of responsibility man for man do you understand me,2
and to show that to to bring that back onto the earth again like a like a monument and everyone would have it standing behind them and and it would make a difference for them,2
and then i went home and it was incredible it had no meaning here,2
it was all like some kind of bus accident to them i went back to work with my dad in that whole rat race again,2
and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys and,2
it felt wrong to be alive to open that bank book to buy that new car to look at that new refrigerator i mean you can take those things out of the war but if you drive that car you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man and you have got to be a little bit better than that,2
i i want you now annie,1
oh annie annie i am going to make you a fortune,1
fine,3
what flashlight,3
yes,3
it is after eleven let us go home,3
not particularly,3
i just don t,3
i am just not,3
yes,3
what time is it is not it supposed to start running around midnight this is great is not it look at this great night we got here could not be better,1
actually i was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid i will miss it how are you doing,1
is that no no no is that foam i cannot even tell although if i if i cannot tell it probably is not it right it will probably be unmistakable but do not you think how you doing,1
oh no you know what i did i forgot my flashlight how could i be so stupid i cannot believe i forgot my flashlight,1
are you cold you want my jacket we should have bought a blanket our blanket this is great is not it,1
i did not even think to bring a six pack a six pack would be just the thing right about now i cannot believe i forgot and look at kid i am surprise i make it out of the house about flies it,1
laughter i wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around,1
you want my jacket,1
right,1
honey this is a natural phenomenon i mean it happens like once a year it is a great opportunity,1
think about people in kansas they have to get a a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh but we are just forty minutes away too good to pass up,1
yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you mating or spawning or something like that,1
this is a big night for these guys life s last orgy yeah,1
okay but they are fish that do something that no other fish do like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that,1
there is there is mystery here and magic a little bit of the unexplainable i cannot understand how you could not be interested,1
look there what is that is it is that a ah it is a seaweed is not it,1
oh this is great i would not miss this for the world i mean think about this i know you are not interested but think about this for a second,1
somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction they do not know why and we do not know why they did not get an invitation and it was not a vote it was not a decision and nobody sent them a map or anything like that,1
it is just some little instinctual time release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the california coast and just started swimming,1
they are swimming right now as if it is the only thing that matters it s it is single mindedness with no mind urgency that is pure urge it s they do not know what drives them they they do not give any name or ask any question they just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death god it is giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm popping up,1
well so what do you think,1
god damn it augie why do you always ask things like that it is so insulting,0
augie do you remember the first time we came to see it it was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought i was pregnant,2
we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing you said the most intimate things right in my ears so i could feel them as much as hear them,2
and i remember thinking finally finally i am as happy as i am supposed to be,1
dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle,2
i rather not remember some things i rather not hope for some things,2
no,2
no,2
this what what is this this is not even anything,2
sure this is standing this is waiting this is fighting,2
but this is not anything like i thought it would be,2
i mean it is just this i mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it is the sand and it is the full moon and i just i am sorry but i could not help wishing i was somewhere else,2
i did not say that,2
for heaven s sake augie wherever i am i always wanted to be with you,2
whatever i am doing i wanted to be with you i mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else somebody who did not take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself,2
good so maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person,1
yes i did notice that it does look really beautiful on the water the gold white moon,1
no i am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all,1
well so what do you think,1
it certainly is not it is slightly exaggerated scientific fact,3
i am not the only one look at all these people,3
carla can i ask you a question now do not be upset are you having a period,3
well we will see them this year,3
wait a minute i got it,3
okay all right i got it you wanted it to be like the other time okay no problem listen you want to dance,1
you want me to go get some champagne,1
take off our shoes,1
what welcome to the human race,0
no i know me either,2
maybe if you are with somebody else too,2
no i know but i know i do not make you happy,2
actually now that you mention it no i don t,1
i do not know seems like a pretty good spot to me i mean look at the view of the moon you got from here,1
well look what we have got here,1
shh if we are very quiet the fish might come,1
or not,1
oh it sent shivers up my spine,1
behave exquisitely,1
yes i shall probably do a court curtsey,1
the whole business is really rather ridiculous,3
meaning exactly that,3
who is they,3
well what if what happens when our love,3
well what if one of us dies does the other laugh then,3
charles that was his name he did wriggle so beautifully,1
and then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers,1
oh ridiculous utterly ridiculous,1
you knew there was nothing,3
good god,1
i wonder,1
hello hello what wrong number,1
with the most perfect poise,1
what does it all mean that is what i asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth dear god what does it all mean,1
all the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable laugh at them be flippant laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light,1
certainly you must we are figures of fun alright laughter,1
who knows,1
no that fire will fade along with our passion,1
it all depends on how well we played,1
yes yes with all his might,1
no no it isn t death is very laughable come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors,1
no so is everyone else in the long run let us be superficial and pity the poor philosophers let us blow trumpets and squeakers and,1
enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren garbage let us savor the delight of the moment,1
darling come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets,1
do you remember that awful scene we had in venice,1
the one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed,1
horrible thing i hate it,1
how long did that row last,1
the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown,1
oh that was quite a rouser was not it,1
oh i did not hit you very hard,3
laughter i shall never forget his face,1
oh we were very much younger then,1
oh as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden,1
you knew there was nothing in that,3
only a trivial little broach,3
you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination,3
maybe just a little but,3
and what of it,3
well i he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it did not hurt me,3
i do not see why you want any you have already had three glasses,3
well it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing,3
it is becoming a habit with you,3
just making myself fascinating for you,3
um it does not seem to have worked such wonders with you,0
adder do not snap they sting,0
they sting,0
i do not care if they bark and roll around like hoops okay,0
yes i did quite a bit,3
mind your own business,0
oh dear you really are becoming quite insufferable i would imagine it is because you are drunk,0
not very funny dear you better have some more brandy,0
why,0
there are not any people upstairs it is a photographer s studio,0
they are away in tunis,0
turn it on again,0
fine if you insist on being completely insolent,0
well do try to control yourself darling,0
you really do need to develop uh a clearer head,0
i i hate you,0
i hate you,0
no no i am tired of listening to you you are boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing,0
yeah very amusing let me go i am getting out of here i cannot believe i intended to marry you,0
oh marry you again i must have been insane what was i thinking i mean you are completely outrageous,0
beast brute cad whore,0
you must admit that he was in love with you was not he,0
you let him kiss you you said you did,0
well that is a nice point of view i must say,0
so am i bored stiff would you like some brandy,3
i will have a little i think,3
you need not be so grand simply because you do not happen to want any at the moment,0
really amanda,0
oh that reply has broken my heart,0
it is a pity you did not take a little more brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable,0
they snap,0
did you see much of peter burden after the divorce,0
i suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then,0
you must have a riotous time no restraint at all very enjoyable i mean you never had much anyway,0
turn it off it is driving me mad,0
turn it off,0
turn it off,0
amanda listen listen,0
very music amusing indeed,0
you are a vile tempered loose living wicked little beast and i never want to set eyes on you again,0
shut up shut up i would not marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee you are a mean evil minded little vampire and i hope to god i never set eyes on you again,0
can i help you,3
oh this this form that you have is the wrong form you need to go over to the other line on the other side of the d m v,3
right but this is the wrong form somebody gave you the wrong form,3
yeah so i cannot i cannot do anything,3
no but this is for um replacements and you need a new whole new license as a california,3

yeah,3
okay,3
did you have insurance on your flight,3
no you have to buy it now it is like thirty dollar extra,3

when i was the first one up he was still in bed how could he have seen it,2
did you talk to him,2
he cried hard,2
the trouble is the god damn newspapers i mean every every week a kid turns up missing like longer than larry,0
well what do you want me to do you are old enough to make to know your own mind,0
i ignore what i got to ignore i mean the girl is larry s girl,0
from your father s point of view he is not dead and she is still his girl now you can go on from there if you know where to go chris but i do not know so what can i do for you,0
well you are a considerate fella there is nothing wrong in that,3
have you asked annie yet,3
well what if she feels like your father and how do you know she will marry you,3
well the trouble is you never saw enough women,3
are you crazy,0
all right but do not think like that because what the hell did we work for chris i mean this whole thing it is all for you,0
just do not think that way do you hear me,0
no i figured it was best to leave him alone,2
why should he dream about him walking around looking for him at night do we contradict him do we say straight out that we do not have any hope anymore that we have not had any hope for years now,0
for gods sake three years nobody comes back after three years that is insane,0
you know,3
i am going to ask her to marry me,3
oh so it is not just my business,0
you infuriate me sometimes do you know that god,0
is not it your business too if dad if i tell dad and he throws a fit about it i mean you have such a talent for ignoring things,0
she is not larry s girl,0
to hell with that,0
so what i am not fast with women,0
i have given it three years of thought i hoped that if i would waited dad would have forgotten about it by now and we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy,0
but if that cannot happen i will just have to get out,0
i will get out i will go get married and live someplace else i do not know maybe new york,0
i have been a good son for too long a good sucker i am through with it,0
yes on this i would,0
well you help me stay here,0
what is he going to say maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it,2
have you asked annie yet,3
well how do you know she will marry you maybe she feels like your father does,3
the trouble is you do not see enough women you never did,3
well that is a good reason but it do not mean a thing i mean you have not seen her since you went to war it is been five years,3
now what is going to happen to your father do you know i don t,2
are you crazy,0
must you be inspired,0
you do not want to think like that,0
he was out here when it broke,2
about four this morning i heard it crack and i looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked,2
i do not know but after he saw it he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen,2
no i figured it was best to leave him alone,2
yes yes he is i do not know the meaning in it but i know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with dad,2
is not it your business too if i tell dad and he throws a fit about it you have such a talent for ignoring things,0
she is not larry s girl,0
what to hell with that,0
i have given it three years of thought i had hoped if i waited dad would have forgotten him by now and we could have a a regular wedding and everybody happy,0
but if that cannot happen then i will just get out,0
i will get out i will go get married someplace else i i will live someplace else maybe new york,0
the business the business does not inspire me,0
yeah i would like one hour a day if i have to grub for money all day long i would like to go home to something beautiful i would like a family i would like some kids,0
well i am thinking like that,0
no you don t i am a pretty tough guy,0
nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see,3
he is got that about it,3
what is going on here joe,0
you above all have got to believe,0
i cannot help it,0
why does that bother you,3
well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again,3
why do you think he is even thinking that,3
what is that suppose to mean me above all look at you you are shaking,0
what have i got to hide kate what the hell is the matter with you,0
you are the only one i know who loves his parents,3
it is all right it is a good thing it is lovely here the air is sweet,1
well your mother first of all pretty much told me to leave,3
i figured they would your mother at least,3
well from her perspective i mean why else would i come here,3
oh chris i have been ready for a long time,1
i almost got married two years ago,2
everyday since,1
well i mean until then you never wrote and when you did what did you say i mean you sure can be ambiguous,1
not like that you are not,1
like larry s brother do it like you chris what is the matter,2
even in your letters there was something ashamed,2
you have to tell me,2
it would not work like this,2
yeah sure,3
how many,2
do you still feel like that,2
because you cannot feel like that anymore chris because everything you have you have a right to me included,2
laughter what will i do with a fortune,1
so you are not sorry i came,1
well,3
you feel it is wrong here do not you this yard this chair i want you to be ready for me annie i i do not want to win you away from anything,1
you felt something that far back,1
oh god i kissed annie i kissed annie i cannot how long have i waited to do that,1
oh annie we are gonna live now i am going to make you so happy,1
lets go for a ride i i i want to be alone with you,2
no nothing like that,2
yeah i suppose i have been but it is going for me,2
i do not i do not know where to start,3
it is so mixed up with so many other things,2
i lost them,2
just about all,2
it it takes time to toss something like that off i mean because they were not just men,2
i know it is it is just a little thing but that is just the kind of guys i had they did not die they killed themselves for each other,2
i mean that exactly anymore selfish just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today and it gave me an idea as i was watching them all go down,2
it was and then i went home and it was incredible it did not have any meaning there,2
i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all,2
and i guess that included you,2
i want you now annie,2
oh annie,1
annie i am going to make you a fortune,1
fine,2
what flashlight,3
i am just not,2
what time is it they are supposed to run around midnight oh this is great is not it look at the night we have got here it could not be better actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people i was afraid we might miss it though so how are you doing,1
what is that is that wait is that foam i cannot even tell oh actually i guess if i cannot tell then it probably is not it is it it will probably be unmistakable do not you think,1
this is great how are you doing oh no oh do you know what i did i forgot the flashlight how could i be so stupid i forgot the flashlight,1
the flashlight the silver one there is only one is not there stupid,1
oh no of course our flashlight me flashlight is to you flashlight naturally,1
how could we have forgotten it well i hope the moon stays out i wonder do they always run during a full moon i cannot remember was the moon full last year do you remember,1
are you cold do you want my jacket we should have brought the blanket our blanket oh this is great i did not even think to bring a six pack oh a six pack would be just the ticket right about now,1
i cannot believe i forgot i m like a little kid i am surprised i made it out of the house with my fly zipped oh laughter,1
oh i wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand or something,1
do you want my jacket,1
honey it is a natural phenomenon i mean this kind of thing only happens once a year it is a great opportunity,1
i mean think about people in kansas they have got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this we are just forty minutes away it is just too good of an opportunity to pass up,1
yeah but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives you know,1
and all that about flopping around it is like laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating or something like that,1
i mean this is a big night for these guys you know life s last orgy,1
all right but they are fish that do something no other fish do like the swallows were turning into capistrano or lemmings jumping off the cliffs you know like that there s there is magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable you know i cannot see how you could not be interested,1
look there what is that is that oh no that is seaweed,1
oh this is great i would not miss this for the world i mean think about this i know you are not interested but just think about this for a second,1
somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction they do not know why they are doing it we do not know why they are doing it they didn t it was not a decision no one took a vote nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that it was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off and all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the california coastline and they just started swimming they are swimming right now at this very moment and and,1
and it is single mindedness with no mind it it is urgency it is pure urge i mean they did not make any decisions they do not ask any questions they do not give it a name,1
they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death god it is giving me goosebumps look at all the hairs that are standing up,1
well so what do you think,1
about what,3
it is ridiculous,3
god damn it augie seriously you always ask me that why do you ask me that i hate it it is so insulting,0
twice is every time we have tried that is ever,0
no we won t it is like waiting up for santa clause or something i feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly my hands clasped neatly in front of me waiting for fish to show up and the fish will not show up,0
i did want to see it i always want to see it i just i keep thinking this will be the time and it never is,2
do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion it was about four years ago right after we got married we thought i was pregnant we had a bottle of champagne and no glasses you asked me to dance we took off our shoes and while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so i could feel them as much as hear them,2
and i remember thinking to myself finally i am as happy as i am supposed to be,2
dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle,2
i would rather not remember some things i would rather not hope for something,2
no,2
no,2
no,2
no,2
i just want i just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to,2
but this is not at all what i wanted it to be,2
this is just this i mean it is a lot and everything but it is not you know something else am i making any sense,2
i know that augie i do i know that and and i know that this meant a lot to you and and it is special you know with the sand and the moon but,2
but i just could not help thinking about being somewhere else,2
i did not say that,2
for heavens sake augie whatever i am doing i would rather it be with you,2
yes do not you know that i mean you are probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else somebody who did not take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself,2
yes i did notice that it does look really beautiful over the water big old white moon,1
no i am beginning to think you might be right i think this might be the spot after all augie i am sorry,1
or not,1
well so what do you think,1
what i was just saying,1
uh carla can i ask you a question no do not get upset but are you having your period,3
it was in the car right when we were passing knickerbocker liquor locker you said let us stop and get champagne and i said that times a wasting or something like that right you wanted it to be like it was before right,3
well welcome to the human race do you think this is what i had planned do you think that when i proposed that i had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish,0
do you think that i thought there would be times when you would look at me like i was used kleenex or i would look at you and think good god when is the next flight to alaska no no i am just like you i thought it would all be like peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish would always come and the bills would magically pay themselves and we would have three fat rosy kids but ha ha baby the jokes on us,0
because you know what you get carla you know what you get this,0
now i know me either,2
i am trying the best i can,2
maybe if you are with somebody else too,2
no i know but i know i do not make you happy,2
actually now that you mention it no i don t,1
i do not know i think this is a pretty good spot i mean look at the view of the moon from here,1
oh well look what we have got here,1
well it is not champagne,1
or not,1
what nobody knows we are here except freda and she would not ring up,1
what do we do,1
now and always my sweet,1
it was bound to happen sooner or later,1
oh it sent shivers up my spine,1
do not laugh at me i am serious,3
who is they,3
if i laugh at everything then i must laugh at us too,3
well will we always bicker and fight,3
what if one of us dies does the other one laugh then,3
elliott worms do not pop,3
i know you did you threw it out the window into the canal below i do not think i will ever forgive you for that,1
oh it burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom,1
you knew there was nothing in that,3
i wonder,1
we are all right are not we darling whatever happens,3
i do not care then,1
oh what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us,1
with the worst with the most perfect poise,1
uhh it is amazing how once you feel,1
things that ought to matter most dreadfully do not matter at all when one s happy do they,1
uhh you must not say that my darling,1
being that sacred and wonderful thing love,1
um what does it all mean that is what i ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth dear god what does it all mean,1
you must not be serious darling that is just what they want,1
all the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable laugh at them be flippant laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths,1
uh the being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light,1
certainly you must we are figures of fun all right,1
no that fire will fade along with our passion,1
yes yes with all his might,1
no no that is quit laughable the cutting little mystery all done with mirrors,1
so is everyone else in the long run let us be superficial and pity the poor philosophers let us blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can like little quiet idiotic school children,1
garbage darling kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets,1
i do not care what you do see you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the place vendome and run with every man in the world and i shall not say a word as long as i know that you love me best,1
do you remember that awful scene we had in venice,1
the one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed,1
horrible thing i hated it,1
how long did that roue last,1
oh the worst one was in cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown,1
laughter that was quit a rouser was not it,1
